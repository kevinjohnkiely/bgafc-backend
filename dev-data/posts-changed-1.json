Having received a walkover from St. Ita's earlier in the day, they awaited the Askeaton v NCW result. With ten minutes remaining and that game all square it looked as if Ballingarry may claim the title, however a late surge saw Askeaton score three times and so finish just one point above Ballingarry. \n\nThis brings to a close the under 14 season. A second place finish in the top flight and a semi final appearance in the cup represents a satisfactory season for Pascal Moynihan and Kent Martins' team.",

The shine was somewhat taken off the result with the sending off of Declan Normoyle near the end.\n\nOn Saturday the club recorded no win from the three teams in action. In the morning the under 10 A side were involved in a cracker as the league resumed after the Winter break. Athea went a goal up with a super strike in the first half with Tiernan Fitzgerald getting Ballingarrys second midway through the second. Ballingarry had chances to win but a fine display from the home keeper ensured a share of the points.\n\nThe under 14s went down in Abbeyfeale while the youths disappointed in NCW going out of the Desmond youth cup by the only goal of the game.",

Niall Condron had already been sent off with a Rovers player before the Rovers were further reduced with a second sending off. Scanlon, Corrigan, Darragh O' Grady and Francis Kiely were successful from the spot while John O' Gradys miss didn't matter in the end.

On Saturday April 12th last they won the first part of the Division 1 double when they totally outplayed Rathkeale B in the divisional cup final to hit four without reply. Denis Kelly kept his remarkable Clonreask scoring run going when he opened the scoring after just four minutes, he has never failed to score for Ballingarry at Clonreask in six games. Declan Normoyle added a second to make it two nil at the break.\n\nIn truth the result was never in doubt and Ballingarry could well have been five up at the break. However Rathkeale just could not stem the tide and further goals from Niall Condron and a sublime freekick from Francis Kiely ensured that the league cup visited Ballingarry for the first time.\n\nOn Friday April 19th Ballingarry again got four against third placed St. Itas to consolidate their position at the top of the table. Both Kelly and Condron were again on the mark as Ballingarry dominated throughout. Second half strikes from Corrigan and Barrett hardly told the full story as Ballingarry could easily have got double figures from a wealth of chances created.\n\nElsewhere the under 12s bowed out of the cup in the second round at Askeaton (April 16th). James Kelly was on the mark in their 3-1 defeat. The 16s collected two points from two scoreless draws against Pallaskenry and Askeaton respectively, both at home with the latter result seeing Askeaton confirmed as champions. The 10A side have hit a sticky patch of late with three successive defeats. NCW (2-1), NCW Rvs (3-2) and Abbeyfeale United A (5-2). Richard O' Keeffe (NCW), Darren Roche and Alan Hanley (NCW Rvs) and Nathan Clancy 2 (Abbey) were on the mark.

In truth this game became a farce midway through the first half. Ballingarry had already drawn level from their first penalty of the day when Scanlon scored after the visiting full back handled on the line. Tulla were now down to ten men and when they felt an effort had crossed the line before being cleared they had a further two players lined for dissent.\nTo their credit they gave a brave performance but Ballingarry were never going to lose this game from there on. Donal O' Gradys hat-trick wasn't just his first for the club but was also the first ever FAI hat-trick from a Ballingarry player.

The under 12 went down 2-1 at Breska Rovers but not without a fight. 2-0 down at the break left them with little hope but a fine second half performance saw them pull a goal back through Nathan Clancy to set up a grand stand finish.

With just two minutes remaining there was no time for NCW to find a way back leaving the under 10 cup travelling to Ballingarry for the first time and ending a truly memorable season which sees six trophies visit Ballingarry.\nCongratulations to Benji Kelly and his squad on becoming the first team in the clubs history to win an underage double.",

It what was a fine game of end to end football. Ballingarry can only blame themselves for not progressing to the third round having missed a host a chances. Jeff Doherty and Kevin Forde both had just the keeper to beat but failed. The wastage finally told ten minutes from time when the home side got what proved to be the winner.\n\nThe under 14s were unlucky not to collect all three points from a fine performance in another fine game. Itas took the lead after just five minutes from some sloppy home defending, a goal that saw Itas froce further pressure on the Ballingarry defence. However once Ballingarry settled they began to play some wonderful football which resulted in an equaliser from Jason Murphy, his fourth of the season in all competitions. Nathan Clancy won the throw and beat three players down the left before crossing for Murphy to apply the finishing touch to leave the sides level at the break. The second half saw Ballingarry apply all the presssure, hitting the crossbar and having a goal disallowed. However it was Itas who went closest to grabbing all three points when Mikey Hickey cleared off the line.\n\nThe under 10s and 8s season has now entered their Winter break and will resume in Feb for the 10s and March for the 8s. At this stage it appears that both will struggle to make their finals with the 8s having one point from four games and the 10s with six from five games.",

Some great work down the left from Aimee McCarthy found Fiona Hickey free in the box. Her shot was well blocked but the rebound fell straight to Marion Neville who made no mistake. Ballingarry nearly doubled their lead when Hickey was again denied after being put through from a fine Jane Hickey ball. Shortly after NCW had their best chance of the 1st half after their striker broke free but a fantastic covering block from centre half O'Grady diverted the ball for a corner. The corner count for NCW grew as half-time neared but Mary Shire and Emer Hickey defended well.\nThe second half saw Ballingarry take control and but for the NCW goal keeper saving bravely at Fiona Hickeys feet Ballingarry would have doubled their lead.\n\nWith fifteen minutes remaining some quick thinking from a Mary Shire throw in set Olivia O'Keeffe through and she squared perfectly for substitute Eleanor Gaffney to score her second in two games. This proved to be the match winner.\nDespite the best efforts of Orla Keating and Rachel Cronin chasing every ball NCW finally beat Catherine Murphy through an excellent individual goal for NCW set up a nervy finish but Ballingarry held out.\nThis was an excellent team win and puts Ballingarry back in the title mix.\nTeam: Catherine Murphy, Aoibhlinn O'Connor, Zara O'Kelly, Emma O'Grady (Orla Keating), Emer hickey, Mary Shire, Jane Hickey, Aimee McCarthy, Marion Neville (Eleanor Gaffney), Fiona Hickey, Olivia O'Keeffe (Rachel Cronin).\nTraining continues on Fridays over the Christmas break, details via text.",

NCW were well worth their 2-0 halftime lead with Kevin Forde scoring for Ballingarry early in the second half. NCW restored their 2 goal advantage but goals from Moore and Snow drew the sides level.

Cathal O'Keeffes first half penalty was all that separated the teams at the break and indeed that was still the case midway through the second period. However as Pallas started to tire Ballingarry took control with O'Keeffe getting his second, a brace each from Sean Moran and Davin O' Donnell and one from Nathan Clancy. Unfortunately the 10s were unable to match that result as their season started on a low note going down 4-1 at NCW. Keith O'Kelly got the Ballingarry consolation.

The first half was very competitive with Askeaton settling earlier and playing good attacking football. During this period Ballingarry defended very well and slowly came more into the game only to concede two late first half goals. The second half saw Ballingarry take the game to Askeaton coming close on a couple of occasions only again to concede two more late goals.

In the opening game they recorded a comprehensive 5-0 win against North Tipperary SL with Nathan Clancy getting the ball rolling when he chipped the keeper early in the first half. Further goals from Liam McCarthan (2), Van and Sean McSweeney sent them into the final against The Limerick County SL.\n\nThe Desmond lads won a hard fought final game which was somewhat ruined by a strong wind with the only goal of the game scored by Ballingarrys Nathan Clancy. Vincent O'Donovan, brother of the late Liam presented LDSL captain Padraig O'Connor with the cup following the game.",

Pallas took the lead only for Forde to cancel it out.

It is a result that sends them three points clear at the top of the division with a game in hand. Ballingarry were very much the better team during the opening half but still found themselves in arrears tahnks to a Doody goal. The second half saw further Ballingarry dominance finally yield a just reward when first Rory Alymer equalised and then finally with just five minutes remaining Shane Doherty got what proved to be the winner.\nTeam: J.

Aaron Smith got Ballingarrys fourth early in the second half with Nathan Clancy and Cathal O'Keeffe adding two more before the finish. Despite the score the Old Mill keeper put in a fine display in a very one sided game. \nThe 10s were also in action with Keith O'Kelly getting the goal that saw Ballingarty win an all action game at Creeves Celtic. \nShane Doherty played the full 90 for the LDFL youth inter league side in a 1-1 draw against Kerry at Clounreask.

Ballingarry went a goal up early from a Davin O'Donnell effort but by half time Kilcornan were 3-2 up with Sean Moran getting Ballingarrys second just before the break when he made the most of a keeping error after Nathan Clancys shot was spilled. Moran with his second drew Ballingarry level mid way through the second period before Nathan Clancy put the visitors ahead when he finished to the net from an impossible angle after a fine run. The points looked safe as the game neared its end however an unfortunate deflection off Mikey Morrissey saw the ball beat Robbie Lynch in goal to give Kilcornan a share of the spoils. Best for Ballingarry was Jason Murphy. Although the point sees Ballingarry lose their 100% record it does see them extend their lead at the top of the table to three points from Ferry Rangers. \n\nAt the half way point of their season the 10s find themselves in second place just one point off the top. Jerome O' Connor set up a perfect pass to Pierse Kirwan who finished neatly after just five minutes. Athea worked hard to level matters after but the Ballingarry defenders stood firm and gave little away for the remainder of the half. The second period saw United do most of the pressing but they found Kieron Storin in goal in fine form where he made some top class saves. Ballingarry were reduced to the counter for most of the half but the home keeper was also in fine form saving from Keith O'Kelly and Grace Mullane. This was a fine team performance with both teams contributing to a highly entertaining game.\n\nOn Sunday the Limerick Desmonds got their defence of the Munster title off to a flyer at Jackman Park last Sunday when they trounced their Limerick counterparts 4-0. Ballingarrys Mikey Hickey played a full 60 at left back during a game they led 2-0 at half time and never looked like losing. Unfortunately Ballingarrys other representative, Edward Houlihan, missed out because of injury.\n\nThe Junior B Team were also in action on Sunday. A first goal for the club for both Nick Danvers and Richard Lenihan just wasn't enough for the B team at Broadford as the home side won 4-2.",

On the mark for Ballingarry were Dean Clancy, Francie Minogue, Sean Lenihan and Richard O'Kelly with a goal each.\n\nThe 14s put clear daylight between themselves and second placed Ferry Rangers with a comprehensive 4-0 win at Old Mill. Sean Moran gave them a 1-0 half time lead with Davin O'Donnell adding a second before a brace from Nathan Clancy secured the points. Ballingarry now find themselves nine points ahead of Ferry Rangers who lost at home to Kilcornan. However Ferry have two games in hand and have also to play Ballingarry twice so there will be no room for complacency.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-844\" src=\"http://ballingarryafc.com/wp-content/uploads/images/stats/dkelly.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Kelly\" width=\"87\" height=\"120\" />On a day when <strong><em>Denis Kelly</em></strong> became only the third player in Ballingarrys history to score 100 competitive goals for Ballingarry, the club secured a hard earned draw away to nearest challengers Pallaskenry on Sunday. Ballingarry had the lead at half time thanks to the latest \"century\" man, this after Shane O'Doherty had seen a penalty saved. The hosts equalised from their first attack of the second half. Still Ballingarry continued to make the better chances with both Alymer and Kelly seeing the keeper deny them.\n\nTeam: Kenrick, C. Kiely, Moore, Fitz (Corrigan), Condron, O'Grady, Kennedy, F. Kiely (C. Doherty), S. Doherty, Alymer, Kelly.",

There were great scenes of joy when captain Killian Begley was presented with the cup after the game.\n\nOn Saturday the Youths picked up the Division 1 title for the first time when they were awarded the three points required to seal the division when NCW failed to show. A fine achievement for the club and the youth will now attempt to secure the double when they travel to Ballyhahill in the cup semi final next Saturday.\n\nThe 15s gave a marvelous performance against much fancied NCW Rovers in the last 8 of the cup but will have to do it all again as the drew 0-0. Ballingarry were given a glorious opportunity to progress to the semi but unfortunately hit the post with a penalty five minutes from time.\n\nOn Sunday the A team recorded a 4-2 win at home to Abbeyfeale United where Colm Kiely got a rare goal from the spot, his first goal in over ten years for the club. Francis Kiely with two and Marcus Moore were the other scorers in a game that saw two of the successful youth make their debuts in Richard O'Kelly and Dean Clancy. The B team were on the end of a 2-0 defeat at Glin.\n[ngg_images gallery_ids=\"104\" display_type=\"photocrati-nextgen_basic_thumbnails\"]",

It is their second under 14 title and their first since 1994 when they won the division 1 title. Nathan Clancy opened the scoring after three minutes with a fine effort from outside the box. Davin O'Donnell finished well to make it 2-0 before Rangers reduced the deficit but Aaron O'Connor restored Ballingarrys 2 goal advantage before the break. The second half saw two Sean Moran goals and a late Cathal O'Keeffe effort confirm their superiority. This was their last game and it sees them complete their programme unbeaten in the league. Following the game captain Mikey Morrissey received the cup from league registrar Ger Costello.\n\nOn Friday the junior captain Pat Kenrick received the Division 1 trophy from fixtures secretary PJ Hogan following their 1-1 draw with visiting Old Mill. They fell behind in the first half with Darren Alymers first goal of the season preserving their unbeaten league record this team, the first time in the clubs history that a junior side have gone an entire league campaign unbeaten. They will now take their place in the Premier next season.\n\nThen finally on Saturday the youths made up for the disappointment of last seasons cup defeat with victory over Abbeyfeale United at Clounreask. It was a game of few chances for Ballingarry with Abbeyfeale making most of the running. A brilliant save from a free by David Condron kept it scoreless at the break coupled with an outstanding display from left full Richard O'Kelly kept Ballingarry in the game. Then with the game in the last minute of normal time out and a replay looking likely O'Kelly picked out Dean Clancy with an inch perfect cross from the right for Clancy to brilliantly head home. It sealed an historic double for Ballingarry having already won the division 1 title and when Tim O'Connell presented the cup to Sean Linehan it confirmed the second time that Ballingarry had won the Desmond Youth cup.\n\nIn more club related news Brenda O'Keeffe and Stephanie Anderson have been voted LDS/GL under 12 and under 14 players of the year respectively. Congratulations to both.\n\nAnthony Forde has been named on the Republic of Ireland UEFA U-19 squad to compete in the elite group phase in Poland this month May 2011.\n\nAnother Ballingarry player making international news is  who played for the Irish schools in the Centenary shield in England. Minogue played in all four games including the final against England while he scored three goals from midfield during his four games.

Captain Alan Murphy gave Ballingarry the lead after just five minutes when he drove a long range free all the way to the net.\n\nKilleaney equalised from a fine header before hat-trick hero Aaron Smith gave Ballingarry the lead again just before the break. The second half was just seconds old when Smith again sent Ballingarry 3-1 up with a tap in following great work from Killian Begley. Killeaney wouldn't lie down and reduced the arrears again with a fine effort from an acute angle. Smith made it 4-2 when he rounded off the best move of the game before man of the match  Alan Murphy scored a glorious fifth following a magnificent solo run from his own half.\n\nThe junior season ground to a half with a 2-3 home loss to NCW on Sunday, a result that sees NCW clinch second place above Ballingarry. Francis Kiely got both Ballingarry goals which were his 50th and 51st goals for the club.\n\nThe  under 15s will try to emulate the 14s when they contest their first ever 15s cup final against NCW next Tuesday evening May 29th at Clounreask. It promises to be a cracker as both teams have an array of talent on show. ",

Ballingarry will be bitterly disappointed as they were the better team throughout but their failure to take the many chances they created cost them dearly. NCW took the lead totally against the run of play when a mixup in the Ballingarry defence allowed the centre forward shoot home from the edge of the box. It was NCWs first sortie into the Ballingarry area on fifteen minutes. Clancy shot wide after making space while Murphy and Smith both went close before the break. It was all Ballingarry for the opening twenty minutes of the second half. Murphy saw his piledriver hit the crossbar and bounce on the line before being cleared, Clancy missed from close in and saw another effort hit the crossbar while Smith again went close. Ballingarry continued to press and were finally caught with just five minutes remaining when the winners got a fine long range second before a third followed near the end.\n\nThe girls teams secured silverware on Monday and Wednesday when first the under 10s lifted the Division 1 Shield with Molly Cagney getting both Ballingarrys goals while on Wednesday it was the 12s turn when they secured the division 1 title when Chloe Collum got the only goal of the game five minutes from time to defeat Askeaton.",

The visitors equalised against the run of play five minutes before the break. Ballingarry had most of the possession during the second period with Broadford defending well. However the winners were not to be denied when Michael Molloy headed brilliantly to the net from a corner. The Bs were also at home with Glin the visitors, both teams were evenly matched with Anna Mullane and Ronal Keating forcing the Glin keeper into fine saves. Ballingarry were defending well with Eamonn Keating, Cathal Moran and Gary Storin working hard to keep the game scoreless at the break. \nThe homeside took the lead early in the second half when Oran Ryan slotted home Gearoid Fennimans pass. Two fast goals from Glin left Ballingarry in trouble as the game neared its end but with just three minutes remaining Eoin O'Connor came to Ballingarrys rescue when he beat three players to secure a share of the spoils for Ballingarry.\n\nThe under 12 girls started their defence of the division 1 title in emphatic style with a 3-0 win in Askeaton.

However with just five minutes remaining the visitors scored to share the points. \n\nThe Ladies team got their new season off to a flyer as they emulated their male counterparts with a win away to Rathkeale. Lisa Kelly (2) and Fiona Hickey were the scorers in an impressive 3-0 win.",

The crossbar saved Ballingarry from a free outside the box while Park thought they had scored from a corner but the ball was cleared off the line.\n\nEight minutes from time they did equalise. The ball was delivered into the box from a free and when Ballingarry failed to clear the ball was scrambled home. Kelly had a chance to win it for Ballingarry but with extra time looking a certainty Park struck the deadly blow when the ball was headed into the path of the Kerry forward and he made no mistake from twelve yards.\n\nTeam: Kenrick; Doherty (Alymer); Fitzgerald; Corrigan (O'Kelly); C.

He was also part of their junior team that won the Desmond cup that season also for the first time playing a major part in both successes scoring in both finals.\n\nThe following season he was part of Ballingarrys Division 1 league winning team and he followed up that success winning their one and only Premier division with the club in 2004.\n\nJoe was a skillful midfielder with a silky touch who had a great eye for a pass. His pace left many a defender in his wake and for many seasons he was Ballingarrys penalty taker, never failing to find the target from the spot. He added another Desmond cup to his collection in 2007 while another Division 1 title followed with a division 1 league cup in 2008 as Ballingarry won the Division 1 double.\n\nIn all he played for seven seasons with Ballingary AFC during which time he won two Desmond cups, one Premier title, two Division 1 titles, one Division 1 League cup, one Desmond youth cup and one Youth Division 2 title while he also played in the Munster Youth Cup semi final with Ballingarry in 2002. He also featured in two divisional cup finals with the club. He also managed the clubs Ladies team for a period.\n\nFollowing his debut for Ballingarry AFC on August 17th 2001 against Breska Rovers he went on to play 175 games for the club scoring 49 goals. He returned to Granagh United at the start of season 2009-10.\n\nJoe was a gentleman both on and off the field and will be sadly missed by his many friends within Ballingarry AFC. The club wish to extend their condolences to his family and friends and his team mates in Granagh United FC. May he rest in peace.",

Receiving award from President Moss Doody, also in picture is James Higgins whose record Colm broke.[/caption]\n\nPride of place over the weekend must surely go to one Colm Kiely who set a new club appearance record with his 364th competitive game for the club in the 6-0 trouncing of Broadford United B in the first round of the Desmond Cup on Sunday (24-2-13). Kiely, who since his debut in September 1998 has featured in every season since was given a guard of honour by both teams as he entered the pitch. Made captain for the day he was presented with a commemorative trophy by club President Moss Doody while the man whose record he broke, James Higgins, was also in attendance to congratulate the new record holder.\n\nKiely has picked every major domestic with the club including the Premier title, two Desmond cups, three division 1 titles and two division 1 league cups. He has also won the clubs Player of the Year award on two occasions while he has also captained the side. He has proved a credit to the club having never been sent off while collecting a handful of yellow cards. As always he was a rock during this game that Ballingarry cruised through, making up for the Desmond cup embarrassment at the same stage against the same opponents last term and a fitting way to honour one of the clubs great players.\n\nBallingarry could have been out of sight by the break missing countless openings. As it happened they went in at the break 2 up thanks to Padraig O'Reilly and Kevin Forde. Denis Kelly got their third shortly after the restart before Francis Kiely hit the fourth form the spot following a foul on Dean Clancy. Eoin Ryan got his name on the score sheet before Kevin Forde with his second rounded off the rout.\n\nNearing the end of the game Colm Kiely was replaced to generous applause by Pa Healy to end a memorably day for the centre half. Team: Kenrick; M. Clancy; Doherty; Fitzgerald; C. Kiely (Capt) (Healy); Moore (Corrigan); O'Reilly; F. Kiely; D. Clancy; Kelly (Ryan); Forde.\nReferee: L O Connor.\n\nIn other news the B team were beaten 3-0 at Athea United in the division 3 league cup semi final second leg to go out 7-2 on aggregate. The 14s lost their grip on the cup they won for the first time last season when NCW Rovers beat them 1-0 while the 10 B side went under 3-2 at Ferry Rangers.",

Anna Shanahan and Phoenix Mulcaire were successful from the spot in the best of three shootout. This was a fine achievement from the Ballingarry girls in qualifying for the finals and while they didn’t bring home any silverware they were presented with certificates of participation in during what was a hugely enjoyable day.\n\nThe u10 girls made it two wins from two in what was another excellent performance at home. The junior B team were in action Sunday against high-flying Shauntrade where Aidan Barrett saved a penalty to help Ballingarry B to a 3-2 win and ends Shauntrades 100% start to the season.",

They were the better footballing side throughout but unfortunately Michael Molloys goal wasn't enough.\n\nThe junior B team were in Abbeyfeale on Sunday but their progress in the Hogan Cup was halted as they went out on penalties after Kevin Moynihan and David O'Hanlons goals saw a draw after extra time. The 14 girls were in Adare on Monday where an unfortunate penalty gave the home side a half time lead. The second was a well worked goal mid-way through the second half. Ballingarry competed well and will be confident for the return in Ballingarry.",

Since then his involvement had been constant and during that time he held positions on the Management Committee and as Chairperson. He managed the clubs A team from 1984 to 1993 while he was also one on the first people to become a Lifetime member of the club when this facility became available in 2009.\n\nAt the time of his passing he was acting Club President having been elected to that position in 2001. This was a position he excelled in proving himself an extremely active President never failing to attend a club function when the occasion arose. Mossie was one of life’s true gentlemen, he took great pride from his involvement in Ballingarry AFC and while he was honoured to be the clubs President it’s equally true to say that it was a great honour for the club to have Mossie as its President. There now exists a void that will be difficult to fill.\n\nIt was a great privilege and honour to have known and worked with Mossie over the last thirty years. The club would like to offer its deepest condolences to his wife Celine, son Pat, a former player, daughters Suzanne, Marie, Regina, sons-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandchildren and his many friends and relations. Also to the many friends he had within Ballingarry AFC, Mossie will be greatly missed.\n\nMay he rest in peace.",

Our team consisted of Alicia in goals, In defence we had Ciara H, Dawn and Aimee, mid we had Ciara L, Ava, Anna and Nicole up front we had Lucy, Aisling and Sarah.\nBoth teams started off strong and determined in the first half. Our defence team and goalie wouldn't allow anything pass them which saw most of the first half being played in Kildimo side. With constant pressure from our midfield and forwards we finally broke through Kildimo defence and Nicole scored Ballingarry first goal. First half 1-0 in favour of Ballingarry. Second half started like the first with both sides determined to better one another. We also introduced our bench consisting of Emily, Laura, Abbie C, Molly, Jane, Brett, Linda, Nicole OD and Chloe. \nBallingarry showed their skills and fitness which saw Nicole score another two goals creating her first hat-trick of the season. Great performance by all who played.

With the assistance of  a strong breeze in the first half Ballingarry found it difficult to breakdown the Shannonside defence with their goalkeeper pulling off some great saves, After 15 minutes it was Grace Mullane that broke the deadlock with a side foot shot low into the right corner. Six minutes later Phoenix broke from the left following a good passage of play with Orla to score our second.\n\nAnna worked tirelessly up front and this paid dividends scoring four goals on the trot before half time.\nThree minutes into the second half Anna scored again and five minutes later following a great through ball from Molly Cagney, Anna scored her sixth. Valerie came on for Molly and teamed up well with Ciara on the wing and scored on 57 minutes and again 60 minutes.\n\nShannonside showed some good passages of play but could not breakdown a well organised Ballingarry defence. Orla scored our final goal on 65 mins. A fine team display by the entire panel.\nCiara O'Doherty, Shauna Hayes, Molly O'Connor, Sophie Alymer, Chloe Collum, Ciara O'Connor, Molly Cagney, Grace Mullane, Anna Shanagher, Orla O'Doherty, Phoenix Mulcaire Shire, Eimear Gavin, Ellen McMahon, Claire Houlihan, Nessa Houlihan Lisa Lynch, Valorie Sheehy, Amy Tagney\n\n<strong>Sunday October 5th 2014</strong>\nMunster Junior Cup Round 2 - Feenagh 1 Ballingarry 3 (OG, Forde, Kenrick)\nGoalkeeper Pat Kenricks fourteenth career goal sealed Ballingarrys passage into the third round of the Munster Junior cup as they were forced to come from a goal down against Feenagh. The home side took the lead from the spot after just five minutes after Healy had fouled. An unfortunate own goal saw the sides level at the break.\nThe second half saw Ballingarry forge ahead when Kevin Forde beat the offside trap to finish well before Kenrick stepped forward to score direct from a free fifteen minutes from time. Ballingarry had to endure some nervy moments throughout the half as Feenagh threatened and indeed could have scored.\nTeam: Kenrick; O'Doherty; Fitzgerald; Healy; R O'Kelly; Moore; O'Grady; Kiely; Clancy; Forde; Kelly.\nSubs Used: P Ryan; Condron; Alymer",

Francis Kiely seemed to have set Ballingarry up for an easy passage when he put the home side ahead after just three minutes but the visitors came more and more into the game and could have been awarded a penalty midway through the half for a hand ball. Fitzgerald also cleared off the line before the break.\nBallingarry doubled their lead just one minute into the second half when Peter Ryan arrived late into the box to score his first goal for the club at the far post. Ballingarry hit the post from a corner twenty minutes from time through Richard O'Kelly before Vee game themselves a lifeline ten minutes from time with a good finish from a tight angle. Ballingarry held out for a well-deserved win against opponents from Tipperary South, a first ever meeting from a club from that league.\n\nTeam: O'Grady; C Kiely; Fitzgerald; Condron; D O'Grady; R O'Kelly; Ryan; O'Reilly; Clancy; Kelly; F Kiely.\nUsed Subs: Cahill; Alymer; Forde.",

Ballingarry fell two goals behind within ten minutes of the re start and things looked glum as the game entered the last quarter. Substitute Kevin Forde reduced the arrears to the minimum when he forced home Francis Kielys far post pass. The visitors hit the crossbar before Ballingarry got a much deserved equaliser in the last minute - Francis Kiely who was magnificent throughout beat the entire Celtic defence to fire a glorious equaliser into the corner of the net to seal extra time.\n\nBallingarry thought they had won it in the first period when from a Richard O'Kelly corner they found the net but the goal was ruled out for an infringement. Ballingarry were not to be denied in the penalty shootout with Darragh O'Grady, Francis Kiely and Kevin Forde all finding the net from the spot while John O'Grady saved the first and the other two penalties went wide.\nBallingarry now welcome Tralee Dynamos in the quarter finals in March.\nTeam: O'Grady; D O'Grady; Condron; C.

He would continue as Ballingarrys first choice goalkeeper for the next four seasons where he proved himself a most accomplished player indeed for the club.\n\nHis attitude towards preparation for games both during training and match day made him stand out as a shining example to those around him and ensured he was held in the highest regard by his team mates. He was voted the clubs Player of the Year during season 1996/97 and by the time he played his last game for the club on May 16th 1999 he had amassed a total of 99 appearances.\n\nHe was very much a gentleman who will be sadly missed by the many friends he made through his love of sport. The club would like to express its deepest sympathy to his wife Margo a former player with the clubs ladies team, sons Aaron and Josh both of who played and play for Ballingarry AFC and his family and friends.\n\nMay he rest in peace.",

Three teams had a chance of winning the league trophy before kick off, with numerous permutations involving Ballingarry, Rathkeale and Breska Rovers to be played out over the hour and a half.\n \nRathkeale started strongly and were first to threaten backed by a strong home crowd. Ballingarry defenders Jennifer Lee and Theresa Mulcaire snuffed out two promising chances for the home side with excellent defending. In the 15th minute the games first real chance appeared with Claire Gohery who was fantastic all game, squaring a low cross, only for Stephanie Anderson's effort to roll wide.\n \nBallingarry's keeper Orla Keating saved from long range on the half hour mark before a pivotal moment in the game. Ballingarry's dangerous right winger Alison White went off with an injury and was replaced by the iconic Mary Shire.\n\nThis change seemed to galvanise the away team, driven on by Shire's aggression and they dominated the last 15 minutes of the first half. Another great Ballingarry chance came when Anderson crossed low after beating two players only for the Rathkeale keeper to save, pushing Joanne O'Gorman's effort out for a corner.\n \nThe second half was only minutes old when Rathkeale broke the deadlock. Fantastic solo play from striker Lyons, saw her beat three defenders and send a cracking drive into the top corner, off the fingertips of Keating.\n \nBallingarry rallied impressively led on by captain Emer Hickey winning challenge after challenge. Just on the hour Fiona Hickey put a beautiful through ball into the path of Ballingarry's potent striker O'Gorman and she finished with style. 1-1. Ballingarry now had the wind in their sails and after more pressure won a corner after great work from stylish winger Kristy Carroll. O'Gorman delivered expertly and Mary Shire rose highest to fire home a bullet header.\n \nRathkeale dug deep and pressed Ballingarry back for the next 10 minutes with Deborah Murphy particularly influential. With just 5 minutes left Ballingarry's centre half Crotty won another brilliant header. The ball fell to O'Gorman in midfield and the rest was pure audacity. O'Gorman spotted the Rathkeale keeper off her line and from just inside her own half volleyed the ball into the net from close to 50 yards.\n\nIt was a fitting finish to what was one of the most exciting leagues in the Ladies' Desmond League history. Congratulations to the Ballingarry team, manager Aidan Lynch and super trainer Gary Shanahan. Without his input and motivation this league win would not have materialised and also to Darragh O'Grady who was always willing to step in at the training pitch when needed.\n \nTeam: Orla Keating, Jennifer Lee, Emer Hickey (c), Sarah Crotty, Theresa Mulcaire, Fiona Hickey, Alison White (Mary Shire 30), Kristy Carroll (Mags Lynch 85), Joanne O'Gorman, Claire Gorey, Stephanie Anderson.\n\nSubs: Marie O'Grady, Aine Tagney.\n\n<strong>Other Results: Monday April 4th</strong> - Under 11 Division 1 - AK Utd 3 Ballingarry 1\n<strong>Tuesday April 5th</strong> - Under 14 Division 1 - Ballingarry 4 (Casey, Geary, Lynch, Sheahan) Granagh Utd 1",

Few chances during the opening period saw the sides change over scoreless. An unfortunate illness meant that after a fine first half Jack Mullane was unable to resume for the second half but the lads rallied to take the lead through a great finish from Adam Picard after great play by Finlay Parabat. With Kellegher and O'Sullivan enjoying fine games and Sheehy and O'Donoghue controlling the middle allowing Cathal McMahon to roam forward at will. Ballingarrys second came from one of these fine runs when O'Kellys hard work won the ball at mid field, he released Parabat who in turn set McMahon up to score but he was fouled in the box and he took and scored the resultant spot kick himself.

O'Grady, Forde, Kiely and both Clancys missed chances to extend Ballingarrys lead and it wasn't until the final minute that Ballingarry got their third when Dean Clancy shot across the keeper.\nThe weather conditions during the ninety minutes turned this game into a battle and battles are won by warriers, Ballingarry had 12 on the day.\nTeam: Kenrick, N Clancy, Healy, Fitzgerald, Cahill, O'Grady, Corrigan, Kiely (Shanahan), D Clancy, Forde, O'Kelly.",

Anderson 76mins) Rathkeale 0\n\nBallingarry AFC Ladies retained the Limerick Desmond District Ladies Premier league cup in Askeaton on Saturday evening by defeating neighbours Rathkeale by the narrowest of margins. Right from the kick off Rathkeale took the game to Ballingarry in an effort to avenge their defeat on the last day of the league campaign which handed the league title to Ballingarry, their second title in three seasons. But Ballingarry’s management team had their homework done from that last encounter and to ensure that threat posed from the Rathkeale strike force of Lyons and Naughton would be nullified, reinstated Moynihan at center half, who was excellent throughout. In fact Ballingarry can be very greatful to its defensive unit of Moynihan, Hickey, Lee and the outstanding Mulcaire, between them restricted the opposition to little or no clear scoring chance despite having the lions share of possession in the first half. In fact, it took Ballingarry 20 minutes to establish a foothold on the game thanks largely to the tough tackling of Quaid and excellent work rate of White in midfield, and got their first shot in anger on the 25th minute when Quaid shot wide from distance after she was set up by O'Gorman. Naughtons angled shot was just wide soon after for Rathkeale and Moynihan had to be on her toes to stop Lyons on the edge of the box as she was bearing down on goal. Confusion in the box between Mulcaire and Moynihan almost presented Rathkeale with an opening but  Mulcaire recovered well to avert the danger.\n \nThe second half brought changes to the line out for Ballingarry with Shire and Neary introduced for Gohery and Lee. Neary slotted in seamlessly at right full, and one felt that Shire's craft and experience in midfield would swing the balance of possession, and so it did, as she contested every ball as if her life depended on it. A switch that would lift the entire team as only she can. With nether keeper troubled in the  first half that pattern was to continue through the second half. 12 minutes into the half Davis tried her luck from long range for Rathkeale but the ball sailed over. Ballingarry had to endure another spell of pressure with the energetic Murphy pulling the strings for Rathkeale. O'Gorman and White did carve out an opening on 65 minutes following a good counter attack but the Rathkeake keeper did well to keep the game scoreless. With 75 minutes on the clock and extra time looming, Quaid was upended 30 yards from goal after a good run. O'Gorman took charge of the free kick, and her dipping shot was spilled by the Rathkeale defence, where Anderson was on hand to slot home from close range. For the remaining 5 minutes or so Rathkeale laid siege on the Ballingarry but could not find the equaliser.\n \nAnd so with the double now secured Ballingarry will now turn their focus to a possible treble when they face Rathkeale again next weekend in the Desmond Ladies Cup Final.\n \nTeam : C Murphy, J Lee, E Hickey, T Mulcaire, Y Moynihan, A White, C Gorey, E Quaid, S Anderson, J O'Gorman, K Carroll.\nSubs: M Shire, E O'Grady, F Hickey, O Keating, S Crotty, A Neary, M O'Grady, A Tagney.",

He would play during ten seasons for the club making all but four of his appearances for the A team. While he was unlucky not to have won a winners medal during his career he was part of the squad that won promotion to the Premier Division in 1993/94 and he was part of both squads that reached the Division 1 league cup finals of 2000 and 2002.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the game he would continue to contribute to the club by managing at underage level and in more recent times with the ladies teams where he was part of the management setup that secured the ladies triple in 2013/14. He will be remembered as a highly skillful player with a silky touch that enabled him to beat his man with ease and a possessor of a keen eye for a pass. By the time he played his last game for the club on August 28th 2002, a Division 1 league cup game at home to Kildimo United, he had totalled 104 games for the club scoring 13 goals.\n\nAn extremely popular figure within the parish of Ballingarry and the wider area he will be sadly missed by all that knew him. Ballingarry AFC would like to offer its condolences to his parents John and Ita, brothers Johnny and Donal, sisters Catherine and Eithne, uncles, aunts, cousins, relatives, neighbours and many friends.\n\nMay he rest in peace.",

Ballingarry fell behind after just five minutes from an expertly finished effort to Kendricks far post. In truth without the magnificent Kendrick who produced at least four brilliant saves Ballingarry would have been buried well before full time. As it was they came more into the game as the first half wore on and a fine finish from Kevin Forde on 22 minutes gave them life.\n\n While Kenrick was denying United Ballingarry were getting close. Nathan Clancy drove wide while Forde also went close. However in the last minute of normal time Pa Healy, after a glorious run form his own half, had the chance to win it for Ballingarry but with just the keeper to beat he shot straight at the Broadford number one and he saved.\n\nExtra time saw United dominate as Ballingarry ran out of steam. A superb finish regained Broadford the lead in the first period before a third in the second period put it beyond Ballingarry. Fitzgeralds header with two minutes remaining gave notions of a miracle. But it wasn't to be as Ballingarry lost their third top flight cup final.\n\nTeam: Kenrick, Healy, R O'Kelly, Fitzgerald, Corrigan, O'Grady (D O'Grady), D Clancy (Kelly), Kiely, N Clancy, Forde, Cahill (Daly).",

Even a saved penalty from Francis Kiely seemed not to matter however debutant Sean Herlihys rash challenge in the box saw the referee point to the spot and the game was sent to extra time. Ballingarry were behind for only a few minutes before Smith pounced after Kenricks free was spilled. Smith gave Ballingarry the lead one minute after the re-start when O'Reillys perfectly weighted pass form the left was volleyed home. Clancy was fouled in the box and the spot kick was Ballingarrys insurance to round four, that was until the penalty was saved.\n\nThen the last minute spot kick to the visitors and extra time. Two goals evenly shared in either half of extra time with Clancy giving Ballingarry the lead in the opening period saw penalties decide with Ballingarry proving the better by the odd successful spot kick in five in the shootout.\nTeam: Kenrick, Danvers (Moore), C Kiely, O'Grady, Clancy, Ryan, Kiely, Smith, O'Reilly (Herlihy), F Kiely, Cahill.\n\nLadies Desmond Cup Round 2 - Broadford United 1 Ballingarry 3 (Gohery 2, S Anderson)",

The game was full of great skill and effort from both teams all throughout with goal chances at both ends with Rathkeale just having the better of the first half with six shots on goal to Ballingarry's two.\n\nThe second half served up more of the same. Great attacking play from both sides gave the supporters good value on a bitterly cold afternoon. Ballingarry had the edge in this half and came very close on a couple of occasions to breaking the deadlock. However Rathkeale were always dangerous on the counter attack and Sam Faughnan had to make an important save in the dying minutes to keep the score level. \n\nOnce again like the previous meeting both teams set out to play football and again it was a great game from start to finish.

It was clear from early in the game that Ballingarry would be the dominant team but yet it was Mungret that took the early lead against the run of play. Ballingarry quickly settled back in to their traditional passing game and this duely paid dividends as Stephanie Anderson opened the scoring for Ballingarry. Joanne O'Gorman followed suit with another and following a defensive error by the home side Anderson seized the opportunity firing to the back of the net. Another from O'Gorman saw Ballingarry 4-1 up at half time.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half Anderson, now on a roll, found sister Rachel with a fantastic through ball and leaving the keeper no chance, completed her hat trick. Three substitutes were introduced 7 minutes into the half, Gohery for White, Carroll for R. Anderson and Cathy Mee for S. Anderson. Joanne O'Gorman went on to help herself to a hat trick and debutant for Ballingarry Cathy Mee grabbed a brace. Try as Mungret may they just could not get on top of these Ballingarry ladies and the score line genuinely did not do Mungret justice as they produced some fine football at times but it was to be Ballingarrys day when O'Gorman, not content with her hat trick scored one more with Captain Emer Hickey sealing the deal with a fantastic score of her own.\n\nTeam: Lenihan, Lee, E.Hickey, Crotty, Mulcaire, R.

The stronger opposition taking full advantage of their opportunities had a fully deserved 3-0 lead at the break. Ballingarry rallied in the second half but couldn't get the score to close the gap and were caught on the break for the rest of the goals as they pressed for a lifeline.

A poor first half was followed by a much better second period where two stunning saves from Kenrick kept the visitors at bay.

An evenly contested first half saw few chances for either side. This though, did not take from the pulsating nature of the game. After the break, play continued in a similar vein where in the 30th minute Claire Gohery recieved a well measured pass near the side line, and with a precision strike the ball beat the Rathkeale keepers reach and flew in over her head to the net.

Ballingarry were a little more controlled playing the ball around really well and had a good few shots on goal but the keeper and a good defensive effort from Shannonside kept the score at 0-0 until 10 minutes from half time when Finlay came up with a fine finish after a poor kick out making it 1-0 at the break.\n\nThe second half started the same as the first and the homeside scored a second after a good back to front move and when a cross from Adam Picard wasn't cleared by the defence, Walsh was on hand to rifle his shot to the net for 2-0. The third goal was a great individual effort from Jamie Forde when after a good run down the wing he dispatched a fine left foot shot into the far corner of the net for 3-0.\n\nShannonside did have a few chances but a solid defence of Lewis Michael and Dylan Picard as well as subs Ciarian and Jim meant Sam had little to do in goal but was quickly off his line when needed. The midfield of Finlay, Jack and Cathal were in total control and are a fine unit backed up by sub Declan with his excellent control and shooting.

In perfect conditions this was a good competitive skilful game. Ballingarrys lads wanted to keep their unbeaten league record and Breska were eager for a good result to finish their campaign. The first half was an even contest with few chances but very competitive with Jamie Forde's exciting drive and shot and Sean Duffy's defending the highlights but it remained 0-0 at halftime.\n\nBallingarry were positive from the start of the 2nd half with good passing and movement all over the field. An excellent free kick from Declan Walsh wasn't cleared by the Breska defence and the ball fell nicely to Cathal McMahon who shot to the bottom corner of the net. Five minutes later Breska were level with a good goal from a long ball. After the equaliser Breska were on top and pressed hard and had four opportunities but Sam Faughnan was excellent in goal to keep the visitors level. It was an end to end game at this stage and a hard working Ronan O'Connor put Ballingarry ahead with a good run and a fine finish. 2-1 to Ballingarry.\n\nAgain Breska pressed hard and again Sam was equal to their efforts and it was his clever long ball to set Billy Kelliher free from the halfway line with two defenders chasing and the goalie to beat he scored our third to wrap up the game after another determined performance.

        "content:encoded": "Ladies Desmond Cup Final - Ballingarry 2 (Gohery, Moynihan) Rathkeale 0\n\n[singlepic id=1769 w=150 h=100 float=left]Ballingarrys ladies retained the Desmond cup to claim the trophy for a sixth time with a goal in either half from Claire Gohery and Yvette Moynihan. Adare was the venue for the Desmond League Ladies Cup Final between Rathkeale and Ballingarry. Thank the Gods for the 4G pitch because the elements certainly weren't conducive to good football and this was apparent in the opening minutes. Most of the first 10 mins was played in the middle third with the industrious Cathy Mee showing up well with some tough tackling and great distribution.\n\nThe game sparked into life in the 18th minute, cultured right back Rachel Anderson went on a marauding run down the right wing and fizzed across an inviting ball that was cleared off Fiona Hickeys toe. It wasn't cleared too far as it fell to Cathy who made a super run attacking the left back again, ghosted in along the end line to slide a pass into Claire Gohery who finished from less than a yard out. Super passage of play that deserved a goal. \n\nThe heavens opened with rain and hail and that put a dampener on proceedings again. The Ballingarry back 4 anchored by Sarah Crotty and Theresa Mulcaire with Rachael Anderson and the classy Lorna O'Connell were equal to the elements and the testing conditions. As the half closed out Rathkeale came more into it. Dangerous at corners and from free kicks they finished the half strongly, but it was Ballingarry that went in 1-0 up at the half.\n\nThe second half started much like the first ended with Rathkeale proving to be dangerous and competent in midfield. The early parts of the half favoured Rathkeale but as the half wore on Ballingarry came back into it. Mary Shire was everywhere and helped stifle most attacks. Joanne O'Gorman was a willing outlet up front and proved with her runs into the channels to prove an outlet for midfield and defence. On 53 mins Ballingarry introduced Kristy Carroll and Yvette Moynihan and it was these two that combined to double Ballingarrys lead 10 mins from time. A swift break saw Moynihan pick up the ball just outside the Ballingarry box and after a lovely deft one two with Carroll the space opened up and Moynihan carried it into the opposing area and flicked it over the on rushing goalkeeper which sparked scenes of wild delight on the Ballingarry sideline.\n\nIn the closing minutes Rathkeale came close as they hit the bar from a free kick and even had the ball in the net but for it to be ruled offside. A goal conceded would have been harsh payment for goalkeeper Noirin Lenihan who was brave and solid throughout with one magnificent save on 50 mins a real highlight.\n\nCaptain Emer Hickey lifted the cup to the delight of the Ballingarry management Aidan Lynch and Gary Shanahan. \n\nTeam : Lenihan, Crotty, Mulcaire, O'Connell, Anderson, Hickey, Mee, Shire, Hickey, Gohery, O'Gorman. \nSubs Carroll, Moynihan, O'Keeffe, Lee, Harnett, Tangney, Shanahan, Murphy\n\nBallingarry ladies have won the Desmond Cup 6 times :\n\n'05-06 captain Rachael Hickey\n'09-10 captain Mary Shire\n'12-13 captain Theresa Mulcaire\n'13-14 captain Theresa Mulcaire\n'15-16 captain Emer Hickey\n'16-17 captain Emer Hickey\n\nAll other games involving the clubs underage and adult teams were called off due to the inclement weather.",

        "content:encoded": "Premier Division League Cup Final - Ballingarry  (1) 2 (O'Gorman, O'Connell) Abbeyfeale Utd (0) 0\n\nPlayed on an excellent surface at Woodfield Estate, home of Newcastle West Rovers and with the sun shining throughout Ballingarry retained the Premier Division League Cup with a deserved 2-0 win over Abbeyfeale Utd. The holders were the better team for long spells of this game and created more chances which ultimately merited the success at the end of eighty minutes.\n\nBallingarry attacked from the off and after only two minutes a good run down the wing by right back Rachel Anderson saw her cross into the area but Abbeyfeale cleared the danger. Two minutes later Anderson was involved again and delivered another cross from near the corner flag which came to Lorna O’Connell whose shot was saved by the feet of keeper Rebecca McGuinness. The pressure was maintained as from the loose ball Joanne O’Gorman sent over a chipped cross to the back post from where Emer Hickey won a corner which came to nought. Seven minutes from this O’Connell picked out O’Gorman but her shot didn’t have the requisite power to test the Abbeyfeale keeper. The same two players were involved again soon after for Ballingarry when O’Connell was fouled outside the right edge of the box but O’Gorman’s free kick was well wide.\n\nAbbeyfeale were finding it difficult to get behind a Ballingarry defence where Theresa Mulcaire and Sarah Crotty were excelling. On nineteen minutes they got an opportunity to do so when Melissa    got the ball in midfield and played an excellent diagonal pass out to the right to Rebecca Daly who got the end line and crossed low into the box but the ball was too near keeper Catherine Murphy who gathered at the near post. Then back at the other end Emer Hickey had a free kick saved by McGuinness. With Abbeyfeale not having any clear cut chances it was vital that when they did get one they would have to capitalise on it and with eight minutes to half time they had a glorious chance when Patricia O’Leary got behind the Ballingarry rear guard with only the keeper to beat but she appeared to be caught in two minds as what was the best option with the result being that the ball ran away from her and was gathered by Murphy at the edge of the area. That miss was to prove costly as Ballingarry opened the scoring two minutes from half time when an Emer Hickey cross from the left was controlled by O’Gorman before firing to the net and at half time Ballingarry it was that had a slender year.\n\nFrom the kick off for the second half it was Ballingarry who were first out of the blocks with Emer Hickey winning a corner which O’Gorman delivered to the back post where O’Connell was unlucky not to get a header on target. The holders continued to press and on forty four minutes doubled their lead when O’Connell curled a beautiful strike into the top left corner from twenty five yards after good play involving Claire Gohery and Mary Shire. Good goalkeeping by McGuinness saw her gather the ball in a crowded goalmouth following a left wing cross from Hickey and she followed this up by holding a well struck effort from Anderson. Then excellent defending by Abbeyfeale right back Dyon Keane saw her take the ball off the line following a Ballingarry corner from their right. On seventy one minutes Fiona Hickey curled an effort just over as Ballingarry remained in control. A strong run by Abbeyfeales Kris Hennessy saw her fouled just outside the box but the resultant free kick didn’t test the opposing keeper. Muireann Cahill tried very hard when introduced and on a few occasions got down the right and put over crosses but a Ballingarry defender always seemed to be in a good position to clear these. Soon after Pat O’Connor sounded the final whistle and Ballingarry had retained the premier league cup.\n\nBallingarry: Catherine Murphy, Rachel Anderson, Yvette Moynihan, Theresa Mulcaire, Sarah Crotty, Fiona Hickey, Mary Shire, Claire Gohery, Joanne O’Gorman, Lorna O’Connell, Emer Hickey (capt).

Leah Twomey (U14 Girls Div.1), Orla O'Doherty (U16 Girls Div. 1), Mike Molloy (U14 Div 1) and Dylan Picard (U12 Div. 2) all picked up their respective awards and will be presented with same later in the month. No other club in the league had more winners, surely a positive reflection on the quality of work being done at underage level within the club. Congratulations to all our winners and of course to the managers and coached who played a major role in their success.\n\n<strong>Sunday May 7th</strong>\n\nPremier Division - Glin Rovers 2 Ballingarry 0\nBoth goals were scored in the first half when Ballingarry lost possession for both goals. The second half saw Ballingarry hold out while under incessant pressure.\nTeam: Barrett, Rankin-Hehir, E Cahill, C Kiely, N Cahill, Clancy, Forde, O'Connor, O'Hanlon, O'Callaghan, F Kiely.\n\n<strong>Monday May 8th</strong>\n\n[singlepic id=1783 w=150 h=100 float=left]U14 Girls League Final - Abbeyfeale 2 Ballingarry 1 (McNamara)\nIt was more heart ache at the hands of Abbeyfeale as the team that knocked them out of the cup also beat them in the league final. Ballingarry played some neat football but were undone by two first half goals. Nicole McNamara reduced the deficit with a glorious strike before the break but this was as good as it got for Ballingarry as the winners proved the better team in the second half and but for stout defensive play from Ballingarry would have won by a greater margin.",

The game was even from the word go with Askeaton taking the lead early in the second half. Ballingarry had chances before they eventually drew level when Kate O'Connor’s effort was too powerful and the keeper left it through her hands. Both teams had chances before the end as the game went to extra time.\n\n[singlepic id=1788 w=150 h=100 float=right]Here Ballingarry were the better with the Askeaton keeper the busier. Then with time almost up Donny Kenny made a surging run towards the Askeaton goal only to be fouled. She set the free up herself and with the last kick of the game scored a superb goal to secure the shield. Ballingarry have played some fabulous football through the season and this display was no different. Their approach and preparation over the season well merited a trophy and the scenes of joy at the end was well deserved. Congratulations to them and their managers Shane Markham, Micky McNamara and Leanne Forde.\n\n<strong>Monday May 15th - Phoenix Stunner Wins Shield</strong>\n\n[singlepic id=1791 w=150 h=100 float=left]Under 16 Girls Division 1 Shield Final - Ballingarry 2 (Mulcaire-Shire 2) NCW 1\n\nA magnificent strike by Phoenix Mulcaire-Shire, her second of the game, saw Ballingarry retain the U16 girls shield at the expense of NCW at Rathkeale on Monday evening last. A truly enjoyable game was lit up by the wonder strike just two minutes after NCW had equalised, Mulcaire-Shires first half opener in which Ballingarry held the lead at the break. Both teams hit the woodwork with NCW the first to threaten in the opening five minutes. Ballingarrys first goal was all about brilliant work from Nicole McNamara as she powered her way through the NCW defence to set up cousin Phoenix who slotted home from ten yards.\n\n[singlepic id=1793 w=150 h=100 float=right]The second half opened with NCW pressing and their efforts were rewarded with an equaliser in the first five minutes. The lead lasted barely a couple of minutes when Anna Mullane made a brilliant run beating several defenders to cross for Phoenix to score. It would prove the winner although there were some scares at either end before the final whistle. This was yet another typical Ballingarry performance, full of fine passing play and imagination. Congratulations to the team and their management of Toby O'Doherty, Damien Shanaher and Martha O'Connor.",

The first half was even with Askeaton holding the lead at the break form a goal that will have disappointed Ballingarry. Ballingarry had hit the post twice before Askeaton scored and one felt it may be one of those nights. \n\n[singlepic id=1801 w=150 h=100 float=left][singlepic id=1806 w=150 h=100 float=right]The second half was a different matter as Ballingarry battered their opponents from the off. A combination of desperate defending, bad luck and wayward finishing kept the Askeaton goal intact. Wave after wave of Ballingarry attacks was looking increasingly like it may end in tears but then as it appeared it was slipping away up popped Mike Molloy to power home a header at the far post to draw the teams level. Extra time loomed until two minutes from time when the ball was driven into the box and one of the Askeaton defender, in a desperate attempt to clear his lines, rifled the ball to the net. It was no more than Ballingarry deserved as they lifted the U14 cup for the second time in their history.\n\n<strong>Friday May 19th</strong>\n\nPremier Division - Ballingarry 1 (Forde) Athea United 3\n\nA massive blow to Ballingarrys survival hopes as Athea won 3-1 at The Paddocks. Denis Kelly went closest for Ballingarry early in the second half when he almost caught the keeper off his line, this following a goalless first half. Almost immediately Athea scored from a header at the far post from a corner. Kevin Forde equalised with a brave header connecting with a cross from the left. However Athea restored their advantage after Ballingarry lost possession on the halfway line and the visitors broke to score. Ballingarry kept pressing but it was United who got the next goal in the last two minutes to secure all three vital points.\nTeam: Kenrick, C Kiely, Fitzgerald, O'Grady, E Cahill, O'Connor, Clancy, Forde, Kelly, Smith, F Kiely.\nSubs Used: Moore, Ryan, Herlihy.\n\n<strong>Sunday May 21st - Survival Secured for Ballingarry</strong>\n\nNCW 1 Ballingarry 3 (Donal O'Grady 2, F Kiely)\n\nThe curtain came down on the season for the club and with it Premier survival for the junior team thanks to this win at NCW. A goalless first half would saw Ballingarry assume control in the second with goals from Donal O'Grady and Francis Kiely giving Ballingarry a cushion. NCW pulled one back before O'Grady with a second secured all three points and ensured Ballingarry would play Premier football in 2018.\nTeam: Kelly; Fitzgerald; N Cahill; O'Grady; Clancy; Moore; Herlihy; O'Connor; Donal O'Grady; Ahern; D Kelly.\nUsed Subs: Ryan; Kiely; O'Callaghan.",

We had\nfurther efforts on target from Nicole O'Dwyer and Sarah Hayes and probably should have scored following a goalmouth\nscramble after Sarahs corner caused chaos in the Askeaton box. Nicole Mc made it 2 just before half time, a just reward for a tireless running performance from midfield working tirelessly with her were Emily, Aimee & Nessa giving the opposition no time to settle on the ball, back line were solid linking with each other effortlessly.\n\nInto the second half we brought in some of our subs and our domination of the game continued, with Kayleigh and Abbie Clancy in particular having a big impact. Abbie added 2 very well taken goals and Nicole O'Dwyer rounded off the scoring with a deserved goal after a hardworking shift up front. Final score Ballingarry 5 Askeaton 0\n\nThis was a very promising start for the girls, especially some of the girls making the step up from 12s, they settled in seamlessly into the team and used the ball very well all game.

A disallowed goal for Ballingarry preceded their second when Forde got in at the near post to maintain his highly productive start to the campaign, this was his eight goal since September, with a beautiful flicked finish from Healys cross.\n2-0 at the break was a comfortable cushion for the home side but that changed early in the second half when Healys handball saw United score from the spot.\nThe visitors pressed hard but this Ballingarry defence have come on in leaps and bounds this season and while United threw men forward Ballingarry were always dangerous on the break. Sean O'Connor should have made more of two glorious chances while Clancy also missed a good chance.\nBallingarry will now host NCW Rovers in the third round.\nTeam: Kenrick; Healy; Ahern; Fitzgerald; N Cahill; Clancy; S O'Connor; J O'Connor; Smith; Forde; Ryan.\nUsed Subs: Gallagher, Hayes, A O'Connor, E Cahill\n\n<strong>Monday October 30th</strong>\n\nU12 Girls&nbsp;- Rathkeale 5 Ballingarry B 1 (Storin)\nAn understrength Ballingarry were beaten in Rathkeale where Bethan Storin scored for the fifth game running and Caoimhe Cunningham in goal was again outstanding.\n\nU12 Boys Division 6 - Askeaton B 0 Ballingarry B 2 (Magner, Daly)\nAn early start in Askeaton didn’t hamper Ballingarry as they recorded a fine 2-0 win against the locals. Ballingarry started brightly enjoying the lions share of possession in the opening half but for all their good work they couldn’t find a break through.\nThe second began as the first ended with Ballingarry pressing hard for the opener. Their endeavour finally paid off with a superb finish from Daniel Magner. Ballingarry, playing a lovely style of passing football were justly rewarded when a second was added from a strike from Ben Daly. It would have been more but for some fine goalkeeping from the home keeper.\n\nU13 Boys League Cup&nbsp;- Ballingarry 6 (J O'Connor 3, McMahon 2, Mullane) Carrig Celtic 1\nU16 Boys Cup - Kilcolman Rovers 0 Ballingarry 7 (Southgate, Leahy, Casey, Storin, Quille, Grary, OG)",

After going 1 down early in the first half Balingarry were unlucky not to score at the other end. Instead GB capitalised on a defensive error to go 2 up. Another GB goal before half time made it 3-0 at the break. In an effort to salvage something from the game Ballingarry pushed forward in the second half. Unfortunately GB were too strong on the day and the game finished 6-0. Despite the scoreline Ballingarry fought hard for the full hour and for that alone deserve credit.\n\nU12 Boys Division 6 - Feenagh B 3 Ballingarry B 0\nBallingarry went one down in the first minute from a penalty. From here on Ballingarry fought hard and enjoyed the majority of the play. A Ben Daly free seemed to cross the line but was not awarded. Feenagh scored a second against the run of play to go 2 up by half-time. They got their third early in the second half. The crossbar denied Ballingarry twice while the home keeper was also on song. Ballingarry will be disappointed not to have gotten something from the game.\n\nU14 Girls Division 1 - Askeaton 0 Ballingarry 9 (Hayes 4, O'Dwyer 2, McNamara, Walsh, O'Keeffe)\nAnother high scoring performance from the girls as the enjoyed the perfect preparation for their National cup fixture next Sunday.

This was Ballingarrys toughest game to date but they stuck to their system of play of fine passing football despite underfoot conditions deteriorating as the game wore on. It took a second half free from Adam Shanagher to settle the game when he shot to the roof of the net after Mark Hayes was fouled on the edge of the box. Despite Ballingarrys domination clear cut chances were at a premium. One of those fell to Pa Gallagher deep in the second half but the keeper saved. Ballingarry expertly manager the game to protect their narrow lead with Long faultless at the back and Shanagher playing his best game so far. Ballingarry will now face AK United for a place in the open draw.\nTeam: Molloy, Storin, Long, S O'Connor, Mulqueen, Kelly, Shanagher, Quille, Southgate, Hayes.\nUsed subs: J O'Connor, Geary.\n\n<strong>Sunday November 5th</strong>\n\nPremier Division - NCW Rvs 1 Ballingarry 2 (Healy, Kiely)\nBallingarry went one point clear at the top of the Premier thanks to this hard fought victory against a good NCW Rovers side on Sunday. In fairness a draw would have been a fair result as both sides enjoyed periods of dominance creating chances that could have won the game for either. As it was it was Ballingarry who took their chances, throw in a superb save from Kenrick and Ballingarry take over at the top from Abbeyfeale United all be it with one game more played.\n\nPa Healy got the perfect opening for the winners when his cross come shot ended in the top corner after just ten minutes. Ballingarry had a goal disallowed for offside before Rovers equalised before the break. The second half could have went either way with both sides missing clear chances before Francis Kiely headed home the winner from a scramble fifteen minutes from time.\nTeam: Kenrick; Cahill, O'Connor, Ahern, Fitzgerald, Clancy, S O'Connor, Kiely, Smith, Healy, Ryan.\nUsed Subs: Quaid, Forde, Brown, A O'Connor, Kelly.\n\nHogan Cup Round 1 - Ballingarry B 1 (O'Grady pen) NCW Rvs B 2\nTeam: Kelly, B Fitzgerald, Lenihan, E Cahill, J O'Grady, Hartnett, O'Keeffe, Kennedy, M Clancy, J O'Kelly, K O'Kelly.\nUsed subs: Walsh, Long, Mulqueen, M O'Kelly.\n\nLadies Premier Division - Abbeyfeale United 0 Ballingarry 1 (Noonan)\n",

Ballingarry were never overawed and it's safe to say they did the club proud with their skillful and committed performance. Although Kilmore dominated the first half with Ciara Houlihan in fine form in the Ballingarry goal it was Ballingarry that got the best chance of the half when Nicole McNamara broke away and but for a marvelously brave save from the keeper Nicole would have scored.\n\n[singlepic id=1885 w=150 h=100 float=right]The game was won in the first ten minutes of the second half when Kilmore got two goals. Ballingarry didn’t give up and were unlucky not to pull one back when Sarah Hayes was just wide from the edge of the box. Sarah had another fine effort saved just before Celtic got their third in the last five minutes. It's hard to find the words to describe the girls performance on the day suffice to say they were magnificent. Their hosts also must be praised for the manner in which they treated the girls, managers and supporters before and after the game where their hospitality was much appreciated.\n\n<strong>Munster Youth Cup Round 4 (Last 16)</strong> - Ballingarry 2 (Hayes 2) Clonmel Town 1 aet\n\nIncredibly its six seasons since Ballingarry last fielded a youth team but boy have they returned with a bang. A 100% record was at stake when they faced Clonmel Town in the Munster Youth cup on Sunday last with a place in the last 8 the reward. While Ballingarry were always the better team with an outstanding visiting keeper maintaining Towns interest in the game with some wonderful saves they still had to wait until extra time for Mark Hayes to put them through.\n\nHayes had already given Ballingarry a first half lead, a lead they maintained until the 89th minutes when the visitors sent the game to extra time. Hayes was both man of the match and hero of the hour with his brace.\nSo it's with much excitement that Ballingarry await the draw for the quarter final, a stage that Ballingarry appeared on in the past when they progressed to the last 8 in 2002.",

Dean Clancy reduced the deficit twice first when he rounded the keeper to roll the ball home and then from the spot. But there was to be no reprieve as Celtic ran out easy winners.\nTeam: Kenrick, Ahern, Browne, Fitzgerald, Kiely, Ryan, Kelly, Clancy, J O'Connor, S O'Connor, Quaid.\nUsed subs: Forde, Hayes, Gallagher, Smith, Healy.",

Ballingarry matched their opponents and even bettered them in the opening half without really carving out an opening. The second half was a little different as Park got the upper hand and although they did enjoy a fair slice of luck with the goal they did deserve to win even if just barely.\n\nHowever it was an experience that Ballingarry will have enjoyed and one that will surely have whetted their appetite for an assault on the competition next season.",

They started very brightly and were one up thanks to a Liam Molloy goal in the first half. Kilcolman equalised shortly after that to leave the score at the break 1-1. The second half saw a change and Kilcolman had 3 unanswered goals. Final score 1-4.\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Cup</strong> - Broadford Utd A 3 Ballingarry A 1 (McMahon)\nThe under 12 boys had an early start this Saturday away to Broadford in the cup. A very entertaining first have saw the teams going in 0-0. Ballingarry started brightly in the second half and went one up thanks to a Jack McMahon goal. Broadford fought back and levelled against the run of play. They then pushed on to score a further two leaving the final score 3-1. A great performance from Ballingarrys boys today and very unlucky to come away empty handed.\n\n<strong>U14 Boys Cup</strong> - Ballingarry 0 Granagh 3 AET\n\n<strong>U14 Girls Division 1</strong> - Newcastle West Town 0 Ballingarry 6 (McNamara 2, Hayes 2, O'Dwyer 2, Kenny)\nBallingarry got back to winning ways following their defeat in Dublin last day out. This was another fine performance against a physically stronger team but Ballingarrys strength is their sheer footballing ability and this again shone through as they ran up another big score. Missing several starters made little difference as Ballingarry were three up by the break. Another three in the second half made it comfortable.\n\n<strong>Youths Division 2</strong> - Ballingarry  4 (Kelly 2, Hayes, Shanagher) Mountcollins 1\nBallingarrys Youths returned to league football and winning ways with a 4-1 victory at home to Mountcollins on Saturday. But even though having the lions share of possession in the first half Ballingarry found themselves down 0-1 at halftime. The visitor’s goal coming from a corner after a rare excursion into the Ballingarry half. The bumpy pitch and strong wind made it difficult to sting passes together but to their credit Shanagher and Quille in the middle of the pitch never resorted to long ball and were determined to try to keep possession when others struggled to do so.\nBallingarrys possession increased even more in the second half and they were rewarded 10 minutes in when Kelly got his first of the day brought about by his own determination dispossessing the Mountcollins defender and firing home his shot from 20 yards. It was Kelly again 10 minutes later scoring his 7th of the season finishing from close range from a Hayes cross from the bye line. Shanaghers 30 yard wind assisted free kick sailed in over the keeper made the points safe on 69 minutes. And Hayes capped off a very good 2nd half performance by scoring his 11th youth goal of the season with a close range strike.\n\nTeam: Molloy, Long (capt,) O'Connor, Flynn, Tagney, Shanagher, Quille, Southgate, Mulqueen, Hayes, Kelly.

However once Broadford equalised there was only going to be one winner as their pace up front caused major problems for the Ballingarry rear guard.

However the good news is that from 2019 football will be moving to the calendar year which basically means that the season will start and finish between February and November in the same year.\n\nThe format has yet to be decided but what is certain is that kids will no longer be expected to play and train during the winter months. This can only be a positive innovation, one that will insure that the children will have a positive experience of playing football and that playing on better surfaces in better conditions will make for better more skilful players. This only applies to underage football ie under 16 down. After what we have experienced so far this season Calendar Year soccer can't come fast enough.",

Even though Ballingarry started the stronger it was the Rovers that opened the scoring when a free into the box was finished to the net. Ballingarry equalised with a beautiful finish from Tony Quaid following a fine move. Francis Kiely gave Ballingarry a deserved lead when he drove to the net from outside the box after Trojan work from Mark Hayes caused havoc in the visitor's area. Glin drew level but again Ballingarry fought back when a fine strike from substitute Keith O'Kelly found the corner of the net. A fine save from Kenrick denied Glin an equaliser before the break.\n\nThe second half was just as even as the first with both sides committed to attack in what was dreadful conditions with snow falling throughout. Clear cut chances were few but when one presented itself to the visitors they gleefully accepted when a deft flick put their winger in to sent a powerful strike to the net. This was late in the game but Ballingarry did have one last chance to send the game to extra time when Mark Hayes effort from inside the area hit the post and was cleared with the keeper beaten.\nTeam: Kenrick; Ahern; Fitzgerald; Cahill; Moore; Clancy; Kiely; Quaid; Forde; Hayes; S O'Connor. \nSub used: O'Kelly\n\n<strong>U16 Boys Division 2</strong> - Ferry Rangers 2 Ballingarry 9 (Leahy 5, Casey, Storan, Quille)\n<strong>Limerick Desmond Ladies Cup</strong> - Ballingarry v Rathkeale (Off due to snow on pitch)\n\n<strong>Monday March 19th 2018</strong>\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Division 6</strong> - AK Utd C 2 Ballingarry B 2 (Lynch, Bridgeman)\nBallingarry came from 2 down to secure a point at Kilcornan.

The permutations where simple - it was must win for Pallas to keep alive their hopes of winning the league, the visitors however could afford a slip up and still hold the upper hand. It's been 7 years since Ballingarry last entered a youth team. That team of course went on to win the Division 1 and Desmond youth cup double. This youth team is managed by Dean Clancy and assisted by John Clancy and Gary Shanahan. Dean himself was top scorer for that double winning team &nbsp;scoring many crucial goals that including the cup final winner 5 minutes from time. The young manager had a selection dilemma to deal with before kick-off with the unavailability of 3 starters, keeper Jack Molloy and Josh O'Connor unavailable and Seanie O'Connor ruled out with an ankle injury.\n\n[singlepic id=1911 w=150 h=100 float=left]But such is the depth and strength of the squad he was able to call on Keith Kelly former LDSL Kennedy cup keeper to step in for the day. Kelly who had been mostly operating as a centre forward for the team all season and with 13 goals to his credit coming into the game would be an obvious loss out field, but the scoring potential of the team would still be a serious one with Hayes and Gallagher up front who themselves have 25 goals between so far this season. Pallas showed their intentions and started very brightly with a high tempo and intensity to their game, but Ballingarry stuck to their game plan of keeping things tight at the back a defensive display lead by captain Long who was impeccable throughout as were&nbsp; all the other 4 defenders used on the day. All though the surface was difficult it didn’t deter Shanagher and Quille in middle of the park from keeping the ball on the ground and constantly providing &nbsp;probing balls through the Pallas defence for Gallagher and Hayes to latch onto. On the 24th minute it was from one of these probing through balls that Ballingarry won a corner their 5th of the half that provided the visitors best chance when Gallagher's header came back off the post from Meads delivery with the ball being cleared off the line by a Pallas defender. Pallas's best chance came when Kelly misjudged a cross and he was relieved to see the ball clip the cross bar and go over for a corner.\n\nBallingarry were happy to start the 2nd half still on level terms and with a formation change with included switching keeper Kelly to centre forward proved to be a master stroke as Kelly went on to hit the winner on 73 minutes when he latched onto Meads &nbsp;back post cross after the winger had made a brilliant run down the left wing beating 3 Pallas players in the process. Pallas threw everything at the visitors in the last 15 minutes causing one moment of concern when replacement keeper Tagney needed two attempts to deal with a good strike from the Pallas forward. With the league title now in the bag the team and management can focus on a possible league and cup double as they await the winners of Kilcolman Rovers and Granagh United in the league cup semi final.\n\nTeam: K Kelly C Tagney A Long C Fitzgerald L Flynn A Shanagher J Quille M Southgate A Meade M Hayes P Gallagher.

Ami Yadav kept United at bay as they started the second half strongly. Ballingarry conceded form a corner mid way through the second. Ballingarry got a deserved equaliser through Jack McMahon and came close to going ahead as they pushed forward. However with just two minutes remaining Abbeyfeale got what proved to be the winning goal.\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Division 6</strong> - Ballingarry B 0 Feenagh 0\nThis was Ballingarry football at its best as the young boys played all the football but just could not find the net.\n\n<strong>U15 Boys Cup</strong> - Broadford Utd 3 Ballingarry 0\nBallingarry bowed out of the cup at the first hurdle.\n\n<strong>Sunday April 1st</strong>\n\n<strong>Premier Division</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (Ahern) Abbeyfeale Utd 0\nWith seven games remaining Ballingarry find themselves right back in the title race following this fantastic if unlikely win against table toppers Abbeyfeale United. A very under strength Ballingarry weathered the storm that the visitors blew up almost from the off and when the opportunity presented itself they took it gleefully.\nFor all their effort United hardly created a clear cup chance until five minutes from time. Then when it seemed they must score up popped veteran Mike Ahern with an impossible clearance from under the crossbar after keeper Shanaghan had been lobbed. By then Ballingarry were a goal to the good and what a strike it was. Ballingarry were a awarded a free twenty five yards out, down the right. Ahern stepped up to send a sensational effort to the far corner of the net. The strike was worthy of the 11 man celebration that it triggered.\nUnited had been warned. Dean Clancy had already brought a fine save from Quirke while Mark Hayes should really have scored from the spill. Ahern went close when his corner was a foot away from the net while Hayes had threatened in the first half. All this before the Ballingarry winner.\nBallingarry are the first club to inflict defeat on Abbeyfeale this season and with seven games to go and just four points behind surely if there is a will in the Ballingarry management and players they will find a way.\nTeam: Shanaghan, Ahern, Fitz, Cahill, O'Grady, Clancy, Moore, Kiely, Hayes, P Ryan, Browne.\nSub Used: Hartnett.\n\n<strong>Division 3</strong> - Carrig Celtic B 0 Ballingarry B 2 (Walsh 2)\n<strong>Ladies Desmond Cup</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (Condron) Rathkeale 0",

        "content:encoded": "<strong>Monday April 16th</strong>\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Division 1</strong> - Ballingarry A 2 (McMahon, Walsh) Abbeyfeale Utd A 3 \nOn a very wet & windy evening both teams served up a great spectacle for those who braved the harsh weather conditions. Playing against a strong breeze in the first half Ballingarry should have been one up after some great passing which resulted in Jack McMahon hitting the crossbar. While Ballingarry enjoyed the lions share of possession they couldn't convert. Shortly before the break Abbeyfeale took the lead. Another fine team passing movement resulted in Jamie Forde coming close and only for a fine save would have equalised. This was the last action of the first half.\nWith conditions worsening credit to both teams who continued to play football. In the second half, a goalmouth scramble resulted in Abbeyfeale getting a second. Ballingarry found themselves 2 down which didn't reflect the game. The home side boys didn't drop the heads and were rewarded with Jack McMahon pulling one back. The pressure game paid off again with Declan Walsh getting a deserved equaliser. Both teams had chances in the closing stages but it was Abbeyfeale who got a third late on. Ballingarry continued to press the Abbeyfeale goal and a Jamie Forde strike came off the bar with another effort cleared off the line. The game finished 3-2 to the visitors. A draw would have been a fair result but huge credit must go to both teams who despite the poor conditions continued to play football throughout.\n\n<strong>U12 Girls Division 1</strong> - Shannonside A 0 Ballingarry A 4\n\n<strong>Tuesday April 17th</strong>\n\n<strong>U12 Girls Division 2</strong> - Ballingarry B 0 Askeaton 0\n<strong>U13 Boys League</strong> - Rathkeale 4 Ballingarry 2\n\n<strong>Wednesday April 18th</strong>\n\n<strong>U14 Girls</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (McNamara) Abbeyfeale Utd 1\nBallingarry will be disappointed not to have taken all three points from a game in which they dominated during the second half. The wind was a major factor but even so Ballingarry coped much better against it in the opening half than the visitors in the second. United went ahead in the first and possibly could have had a second but Ballingarry had chances too.\nOnce Nicole McNamara got Ballingarry back on terms early in the second half it looks as if the home side would win but a combination of bad luck and good defending ensured that the game ended in a draw.\n\n<strong>Thursday April 19th</strong>\n\n<strong>U12 Girls Division 1</strong> - Ballingarry A v Newcastle West Town A (Walkover to Ballingarry)\nThe points collected from this walkover ensures that Ballingarry cannot be caught at the top of the table and that they are crowned Division 1 champions.\n\n<strong>Friday April 20th</strong>\n\n<strong>Premier Division - </strong>Granagh Utd 3 Ballingarry 3 (Forde 3)\nNot for the first time this season have Granagh United seen a two goal cushion slip. As they did in the first meeting of these two sides at the start of the season Ballingarry came storming back to deny United victory. The home side took the lead in the second minute when the ball took a wicked deflection to deceive Kelly in goal. Their second came from the spot to see them well ahead at the break.\nKevin Fordes first of three came early in the second half but Granagh restored their 2 goal lead from a corner. Fordes second came from a scramble as the ball was delivered from a free while his third came from the spot after Clancy was fouled by the keeper.\nTeam: Kelly, Fitzgerald, O'Grady, Hartnett, Browne, Kiely, Clancy, Forde, Moore, Walsh, Ryan.\nUsed subs: O'Hanlon.\n\n<strong>Saturday April 21st</strong>\n\n<strong>U10 Boys</strong> - AK Utd A 4 Ballingarry 5\n<strong>U12 Girls Cup</strong> - Abbeyfeale Utd 0 Ballingarry A 3 (O'Connor 2, Kenny)\nThe under 12 girls moved towards an unprecedented double as the booked their place in the cup final with this impressive semi final win in Abbeyfeale.\n\n<strong>U16 Girls 4/5 Playoff</strong> - Ballingarry 2 (O'Connor 2) Askeaton 1\n<strong>Youths Division 2 League Cup Semi Final</strong> - Ballingarry 4 Granagh Utd 0\nBallingarry are in line to complete the Division 2 double as the secured a final place with this easy win against Granagh United.

This is indeed a great honour for the club, her parents, her managers and coaches and of course for the player herself. It had been a fine year for the player as she had already captained her clubs U14 team to league success and the LDS/GL Gaynor squad to success in the Bowl final where she received Player of the Match award from Ireland women’s International player Claire O'Riordan.\n\nNicole will be hoping to captain the Munster side to success in the Interprovencials which will begin on Friday November 16th at the AUL complex Clonshaugh. The Interprovincial series will be the first step in the process of selecting the FAI Schools International Development squad of 18 players who will compete in the Bob Docherty Cup. The 2018/19 campaign will see the Republic of Ireland Schools select travel to Spain for this season’s Home Nations event. The International series will take place during the Easter break.

The home side probably had the better team but it was Ballingarry that created the chances and had the referee been better positioned he would have awarded Ballingarry a lead goal when Aaron O'Connors shot was parried by the keeper with the ball crossing the line before he recovered.\n\nThe home side opened well with O'Grady making a fine save to deny them from a corner. Kevin Laffan cleared off the line as well but the best chance of the game fell to Fitzgerald when he shot straight at the keeper from ten yards. Conor Laffan just lost the control that would have seen through before the break. The second half was even and entertaining with the certainty that one goal would settle the game. It came ten minutes from time. O'Gradys roll to Hanley failed to reach its target, the ball was intercepted and from there the danger increased and ended with the ball in the net.\nTeam: O'Grady, Hanley; Fitzgerald; Cahill; Kiely; O'Connor; K Laffan; C Laffan; Mulqueen; Flynn; O'Kelly.\nUsed subs: J O'Connor; Hayes",

Delaney was at the Paddocks to unveil a plaque presented to the club by the FAI on their notable achievement of being awarded the FAI Club Mark.\n\n\nAs always Ballingarry AFC are showing leadership when it comes to promoting and fostering football in the proper manner within the Limerick Desmond area. They are the first club within the Limerick Desmond area to be awarded this quality mark and indeed just the twelfth club in Ireland to achieve this mark. When considering there are 2000 clubs in the country then it strikes home where Ballingarry AFC are in this respect.\nAlso in attendance were Joan Croke LDLL, John Roche Referees Society, Joe Hogan LDFL and Charlie Boyle LDS/GL.\nA special mention to Shane Markham, Mickey McNamara and Jason Quinn who dedicated an enormous amount of time and energy to achieving this recognition for the club.\n\n<strong>Sunday October 28th - Juniors get first win.</strong>\n\n<strong>Munster Junior Cup Round 2</strong> - Shauntrade 0 Ballingarry 2 (K Laffan, Moore)\nHaving played well enough to have won the previous Sunday, Ballingarry will be relieved to have played well and win to progress to the third round in Munster in their most recent outing. Kevin Laffans first goal for the club, a superbly placed effort from outside the box, sent Ballingarry on their way in the first half. Marcus Moore’s powerful shot mid way through the second sealed Ballingarrys first win of the season.\nTeam: O'Grady; Cahill; Flynn; Hanley; C Laffan; K Laffan; Danvers; Long; O'Kelly; A O'Connor; Healy.\nUsed Subs: Moore; Mulqueen.\n\n<strong>Monday October 29th - Four teams qualify for league finals</strong>\n\nBallingarrys under 12 boys B team and their U16 and U14 girls teams joined their U12 girls A team in their respective league finals after winning their last league games over the weekend.\n\n<strong>U/12 Boys Div 6 </strong>- Pallaskenry 1 Ballingarry B 2 (Long, Daly)\nOn this bank holiday Monday Ballingarry boys under 12 B team made the away trip to Pallaskenry for an early 10am start. Needing a win or draw to make the league final they knew it was in their own hands. Starting very brightly they took control for large periods of the first half. While dominating in possession they had a few moments when their back line was called into action and they duly answered.\n\nWith 2 minutes to half time it was 0-0 but after some nice work down the right touchline Pallaskenry broke the deadlock to leave it 1-0 to the home side. The second half started in similar fashion to the first with Ballingarry picking up the pace.\n\nPlaying out from the back, through midfield Kieran Long got on the end of a pass from Ben Daly. Long still had a bit of work to do but made no mistake in getting Ballingarry back on level terms. With confidence high they pushed for a winner. The Pallaskenry keeper made some fine saves to keep it level until a cracker from Ben Daly got the roof of the net with 10 minutes remaining. The final score was 1-2&nbsp;to Ballingarry.\n\nHuge thank you to all who came out to support is today. Great to see so many there.\n\n<strong>U/14 Boys Div 2</strong> - Broadford Utd A 3 Ballingarry A 1 (Moran)\n<strong>U/14 Girls Div 1</strong> - Shannonside 1 Ballingarry 7 (McNamara 5, Clancy, C O'Keeffe)\nAnother high scoring win for Ballingarry sees them in the Division 1 league final against Abbeyfeale United. Nicole McNamara with 5 goals was the star of the show with Abbie Clancy and Chloe O'Keeffe getting the other 2.",

        "content:encoded": "Now that the underage “short season” is coming to an end the club can review their progress and look forward to several league finals. The U12 boys A team will compete in the Division 1 shield while the clubs B team will feature in the division 6 league final against AK United C. This after the B team have won all their games, form that should see the approach the final with confidence.\n\nThe same applies to the U12 girls teams. The B team will compete in the Division 2 shield while the A team will play in the Division 1 final where they will put their 100% record on the line against either Broadford or Rathkeale. Both U14 girls and U16 girls teams have secured their Division 1 league finals where both will face Abbeyfeale United.\n\nNeither of the U14 boys have secured a final spot with the A team in a three way playoff to see who faces Broadford United in the division 1 final. The B team will play in the division 3 shield competition. The under 16 boys are not in the league final yet but their destiny is in their own hands as their final game against Broadford will decide, where a draw will be enough.\n\n<strong>Saturday, November 3rd</strong>\n\nU/12 Girls Division 1 - Ballingarry A 9 (K O'Connor 4, R O'Connor, Kenny 2, Geary, Quinn) Shannonside A 0\nU/12 Girls Division 2 - Ballingarry B 0 Kildimo Utd 1\n\nU/12 Boys Division 2 - Ballingarry A 1 (Forde) AK Utd B 6\nBallingarry started brightly and went close only to find themselves a goal down after 10 minutes totally against the run of play. Credit to Ballingarry who kept the pressure up and were back on terms through Jamie Forde shortly after conceding. The home side had the lion’s share of possession for the remainder of the half and should have went in at half time ahead. Ballingarry found themselves under pressure early in the second half and during a difficult five minute period conceded 3 goals. Ballingarry never allowed their heads to drop but found the AK keeper in fine form. AK added another two goals near the end.\n\nU14 Boys Division 3 - Ballingarry B 0 Newcastle West Town B 3\n\nU/16 Girls National Cup (et & pens) - Newcastle West Town 1 Ballingarry 5 (McNamara 3, O'Keeffe, Walsh).\nThe foundations for Ballingarrys progress to the second round were set in the first half where Nicole McNamara scored three of the four to set Ballingarry on their way. Another either side of the break from Aimee O'Keeffe and s free kick from Saoifre Walsh had Ballingarry coasting before NCW got their consolation.\n\nMunster Youth Cup Rd. 2 - NCW Town 2 Ballingarry 6 (Hayes 4, Sparling, Flynn)\nAlthough the score line may suggest otherwise this was not an easy passage in NCW. The opening goal didn't arrive until 20 minutes in and even then it was against the run of play. From there Balllingarry settled with Mark Hayes getting four and both Luke Flynn and young Sparling getting the other two.\n\nAll football games nationwide were off Sunday November 4th on an FAI directive to allow players enjoy the WFAI ad FAI Senior cup finals.",

        "content:encoded": "Overall a disappointing weekend that saw several of the clubs teams season end in disappointment, the beacon being the youths progress in the FAI Youth cup.\n\n<strong>Saturday Nov 10th 2018 - 12 As season ends</strong>\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Div 2 Shield Semi Finals</strong> - Kildimo Utd 2 Ballingarry A 0\nBallingarrys season ended here with this 2-0 defeat. They were very much the dominant force throughout but unfortunately could not transfer their superiority into goals.\n\n<strong>Ballingarry left disappointed - U/14 Girls Div 1 League Final (Rathkeale)</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (McNamara) Abbeyfeale Utd 3\n[singlepic id=2113 w=150 h=100 float=left]Ballingarry went under in the U14 Girls division 1 league final when they found old rivals Abbeyfeale United just too good for them on the day. Ballingarry got off to the perfect start when after just two minutes Nicole McNamara gave them the lead. The ball was fed down the right where Donna Kenny took control, her square pass was collected by Nessa Markham and she put Nicole McNamara in on goal where her first effort was stopped by the keeper however she failed to hold the ball and Nicole made certain from close in.\n\nSarah Hayes was just wide with a chip after eight minutes with United drawing level four minutes later when their mid fielder drove the ball high over Ciara Houlihan to the roof of the net. The winners keeper made a fine save to deny McNamara after Markham had created the opening, while a long range effort from Walsh was easily held.\nThe second half was difficult for Ballingarry with Abbeyfeale the better side. \n\nTwo set piece goals proved to be Ballingarrys undoing the first from a corner from the right after fifty minutes and the second five minutes later this too from a corner from the left. Both awards were questionable as it appeared that an Abbeyfeale played got the final touch. They found the Blues keeper in fine form who never put a foot wrong through the second half.\nBallingarry will be disappointed not to have restored their lead just after the break when McNamara was put through but was pulled for offside, however as the ball and come off a defenders head it surely was not offside. A poor call indeed.\n\n<strong>U14 Boys Div. 2 Playoff - Ballingarry must settle for shield </strong>- Killeaney 4 Ballingarry 2 \nA win here would have put Ballingarry in the league final however they must now settle for a shield semi-final.\n\n<strong>Youths in last 32 - FAI Youth Cup Rd. 2</strong> - Ballingarry 3 (Quille 2, Sparling) Tralee Dynamos 0\n[singlepic id=2114 w=150 h=100 float=left]A truly superb by a fine Ballingarry youth side saw them into the last 16 of the FAI youth cup at the expense of visiting Tralee Dynamos last Saturday. Ballingarry were the dominant team throughout with their first half display simply marvellous.\n\nBallingarry could have been three up before they opened the scoring in the eighteenth minute. Hayes was denied after two minutes by the keeper after six minutes the same player headed wide from a corner. Andrew Meade cross from the left was met by right full Kirwan but the shot was off target. The deserved lead goal arrived following fine work from Hayes and O Kelly who laid the ball to Quille who stroked home form the edge of the box.\n\nMeade and Hayes were again involved with the latter seeing his effort blocked and just before the break Jack Molloy in goal was called into action when he dropped a free kick but luckily the danger was cleared. The half time whistle sounded without the opposition having a serious incursion into the Ballingarry half. Ballingarry started the second period where they left off with Mark Hayes just shooting over following inspirational work from Quille in midfield.\n\nA fine tackle from Flynn led to a corner when the outcome could have been much worse just before O Kelly’s powerful effort was just off target. Tangney’s quick restart from a throw put Hayes into the box only for the keeper to make a good save at the expense of a corner. Ballingarry doubled their lead on 76 minutes with a second from Josh Quill. It was a beautiful finish from a great pass form Mark Hayes.\n\nBallingarry s third two minutes later was the icing on the cake. The Dynamos were awarded a free down the right, the ball was delivered into the box, cleared just outside the box where Mark Hayes took control and took the ball to the edge of the box before putting it on a plate for Sparling to score. It was the pace of the counter and the desire to get another that impressed. The last chance of the game fell to the visitors but a firm header found the side netting.\n\n<strong>Sunday November 11th - 16s In playoff</strong>\n\n<strong>U16 Div 1 League Playoff</strong> - Broadford Utd 2 Ballingarry 0\nA win here would have put Ballingarry straight into the league final, as it is now Ballingarry will have to meet Broadford in the semi-final.\n\n<strong>Ballingarry in League final - U/16 Girls Div 1 - </strong>Newcastle West Town 1 Ballingarry 1 (Dalton)\nA game of little significance saw NCW snatch a draw after Ballingarry had taken the lead. Ballingarry were already in the league final.\n\n<strong>Ballingarry bow out of National cup - U14 Gls Nat Cup Rd. 2</strong> - Ashling-Annacotty 3  Ballingarry 2 (Clancy 2)\nA fabulous game saw Ballngarry lose out by the odd goal in five. Two evenly matched teams offered up a fine game with all that is good about football on display. The home side went ahead midway through the half. In truth the goal should not have stood as when the player received the ball she was well offside, however the ref on the day way too far behind play to see.\n\nKelsy Quinn in goals made two quiet magnificent saves to keep Ballingarry in the game while both Emma McNamara and Abbie Clancy had chances to restore parity before the break but both girls were off target.\n\nThe second half was as exciting as the first however the wind was somewhat taken from Ballingarry with a second Ashling goal. A scrambled effort from Abbie Clancy gave Ballingarry great hope before a long range effort from the home sides midfielder found the net. Abbie Clancy’s second on the stroke of time was a consolation. This was a fine display from all the girls and one both managers and players can feel proud of.\n\n<strong>Points shared in Granagh - Premier Divsion</strong> - Granagh Utd 2 Ballingarry 2 (Laffan, O'Kelly)\nThe scenes at the end told their own story, wild celebrations from the home side, Ballingarry heads bowed. It was a game Ballingarry should have wrapped up long before the end. Pa Healy headed over in the first half to leave the sides level. Kevin Laffan put Ballingarry a goal to the good early in the second half before substitute Keith O'Kelly headed home a corner with twenty to go. Granagh pulled a goal back with a well struck free kick fifteen minutes from time before Keith O'Kelly saw David Condron saw a one v one that would surely have given Ballingarry all three points.  With the last kick of the ball Granagh equalised from a scramble after the ball was delivered from a free. Cue unbridled celebrations for the home side.\nTeam: O'Grady, Cahill; Fitzgerald; Flynn; Laffan; Meade; A O'Connor; Healy; Long; Hanley; Hartnett.\nUsed subs: Danvers; O'Kelly.",

Ballingarry conceded after ten minutes, before that keeper Sean Faughnan had made two good saves. Ballingarry almost equalised after fifteen minutes when Thomas Roche saw his effort saved. Ten minutes before the break Ballingarry had a good chance to draw level when Bernie was fouled and Daly saw his free go just over the bar.\n\n[singlepic id=2115 w=150 h=100 float=right]However Ballingarry were given a mountain to climb in the second half when AK got a second goal just before the break. Two minutes into the second half United got a third that clinched the game. Ballingarry did threaten during a much improved second half showing. The introduction of Long and Molloy made a difference with both threatening. This was a fine effort form Ballingarry with many fine performances throughout and no doubt the experience of playing in a final will stand to come in the seasons ahead.\n\n<strong>Youths bow out - Munster Youth Cup Rd. 3 </strong>- Ballingarry 0 Broadford Utd 1\nFollowing from the heroics of the previous week Ballingarry were left bitterly disappointed to be knocked out of the provincial tournament by Broadford.

A mix up between O'Grady and Fitzgerald presented the visiting forward with the easiest of chances with just five minutes remaining. Before that Ballingarry had taken a first half lead through Kevin Laffan. Mark Hayes saw his penalty saved before Aaron O Connor drove over from six yards.

Sarah Hayes had Ballingarrys only real chance in the first half but she shot straight at the keeper.\n\nThe second half saw little change in the game with Abbey doing most of the pressing.

        "content:encoded": "<strong>WFAI National Cup 4th Round</strong> - Salthill Devon 1 Ballingarry 1 (Hayes 31) AET (BGarry win 4-1 pens)\n\nIt was the Ballingarry that left Galway singing Ay I Ay I Ay last Sunday as they progressed to the last four of the WFAI Women’s Cup and a meeting with Hanover Harps of Carlow.\n\n[singlepic id=2143 w=150 h=100 float=left]This was an epic encounter more so because of the elements than the opposition and although the final scoreline and a penalty shoot success may indicate a close fought battle the truth was that Ballingarry were deserving winners in the end and but for a combination of bad luck and stout defending would have booked their passage long before the finish. Ballingarry had their home work done, this was evident ten minutes in when the home game plan of playing out from the back was abandoned such was the intense high press from the front three of Amy O'Keeffe, Abbie Clancy and Sarah Hayes. It was a tactic that almost yielded the perfect start when Hayes closed down the full back leaving the keeper to make a desperate clearance as Clancy closed in.\n\nBallingarry almost went ahead after fifteen minutes when O Keeffe marauded down the left and her driven cross just evaded both Clancy and Hayes. O Keeffe was to torment her marker for the entire game with her powerful runs always a threat. It was a day that Nicole McNamara could well have had a hattrick. Once in the first half when the side netting was struck, once in the second half when she rounded the keeper only to see a magnificent goal line clearance save the day and once in extra time when the keeper denied her in a one on one.\n\nWhen Salthill threatened to overrun Ballingarry in the second half with the wind in their favour they found the visiting defence magnificent. Both full backs, Saoifre Walsh and Abbie O Shea knew the threat posed from two lightening fast wingers and they respond in Trojan fashion with O Shea in particular one of the winners stand out players. The centrehalf pairing of Molly McCarthy and Laura McMahon were flawless in their protection of Keeper Ciara Houlihan who herself made a crucial save to parry the ball against the post, this in the first held when the sides were tied at 1.1. The home side had taken the lead after 29 minutes when a shot come cross from the left deceived Houlihan and the ball ended in the net. However a team is at its most vulnerable just after scoring and this was indeed the case as Ballingarry equalised within two minutes of the restart.\n\nLeah Twomey combined with Anna Mullane to start the move from midfield combining with O Keeffe for Mullane to carry the ball into the box from where her fine cross was met first time by Sarah Hayes who had timed her arrival at the far post to perfection.\n\nThe second half saw Devon enjoy most of the possession but they found a Ballingarry rearguard in unbeatable form and indeed it was Ballingarry that had the better chances on the break. McNamara’s shot off the line was one while Clancy had a goal rule offside. Extra time arrived which presented two memorable moments. Abbie O Sheas clearance with the Devon player bearing down on goal and then the keeper’s brave denial of Nicole McNamara’s effort.\nSafe to say that the penalty shootout was a display of nerves of steel from the Ballingarry players.\n\nKeeper Houlihan saved the first two with the second a fine save while Amy O Keeffe, Nicole McNamara, Abbie Clancy and Sarah Hayes took the perfect spot kick.\n\n4-1 on penalties saw Ballingarry make club history becoming the first side to carry the famous Green and Gold into a National semi final.\n\n<strong>Saturday February 9th</strong>\n\n<strong>Desmond Youth Cup Quarter Final</strong> - Ballingarry v Ferry Rangers ( W/O to Ballingarry)\n\n<strong>Sunday February 10th </strong>\n\n<strong>Desmond Cup Round 1 </strong>- Ballingarry 3 (Forde 2, Hartnett) Rockhill Rvs 0\n<strong>Ladies Premier Division</strong> - Ballingarry 2 (Mullane, Noonan) Breska Rvs 1",

        "content:encoded": "<strong>Sunday February 17th - BALLINGARRY BOW OUT WITH HEADS HELD HIGH - By Frank Nelligan</strong>\n\n<strong>FAI Youth Cup Round 4 (last 16)</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (M. Hayes 5) Mervue United 2 (L. Neravan 19, M. Deveney 97) (aet)\n\nA gallant defeat was the lot of Ballingarry in the last 16 of the FAI Youths Cup on Sunday afternoon, beaten 2-1 in extra-time by Galway visitors, Mervue United. There was little between the teams in the first-half and so 1-1 was a fair score at half-time. It was Balllingarry who opened the scoring in the 5th minute, Mark Hayes heading past Patrick Moynihan from a cross by Garret Sparling. Mervue drew level in the 19th minute when Lewis Neravan’s header from Mark Melodin’s cross took a wicked defelction, totally wrongfooting goalkeeper Keith O’Kelly.\n\nMervue were by far the better team in the second-half, most of which was played in the Ballingarry half. Through well-organised and committed defending, Ballingarry managed to prevent Mervue from converting their superiority into scores, which meant that they were in with a chance themselves of scoring a winner against the run of play. They very nearly did just that in the 80th minute when Hayes was unlucky to see his curling effort from 16 yards come back off the post. \n\nMervue didn’t manage to maintain their high gear in extra-time but they did score the winner midway through the first period, substitute Mikey Deveney, the smallest player on the pitch, heading inside the right-hand post from a cross by another substitute, Ryan Gallagher. \n\nLong before these Youths players were born there was an ITV show called Opportunity Knocks where host Hughie Green used a clapometer to get an indication from the audience as to their views on the popularity of the various contestants. There was no clapometer in Ballingarry last Sunday but the volume levels from the well-populated stand was a good indicator as to how this game went. The approving roars were fairly constant in the first-half as the home supporters had plenty to enthuse about. Ballingarry were matching the visitors for passing and movement in a high-tempo contest and they were immense in pressing as a team. \n\nAfter Mervue’s equaliser, Ballingarry continued to show plenty of ambition as they sought to regain the lead. They came close midway through the half when Cian Kirwan fired across goal from a cross by Sparling and his effort was kept in by Hayes, who fired wide of the near post. In the 39th minute, a Kirwan free-kick was almost deflected into the net by a defender but, luckily for Mervue, it hit the side-netting instead. \n\nThe Ballingarry supporters had much less to get excited about in the second-half, though there was plenty to admire about the team’s defending. Centre-half Adam Long, who had headed off the line in the 16th minute, was impeccable in his positioning and timing of tackles, while, beside him, the aerial prowess of Luke Flynn proved crucial on a few occasions. The under-pressure back four needed help from their midfield and they certainly got plenty of that from Josh Quille, who made lots of vital tackles and challenges.\n \nManager Dean Clancy and his father John, who is his assistant, knew that as long as they could keep the tie level they had a player up front in Hayes who could prove the difference if a chance came his way. The Mervue defenders were also aware by now of the threat posed by Hayes and they closed him down in a pincer movement to snuff out the danger when he collected a Quille pass in the 77th minute, three minutes before his curler that deserved a goal but hit the post instead.\n\nThe Mervue management knew that it would take something special to break the Ballingarry resistance which is why they brought on two very good attacking players, Deveney and Gallagher, in the 55th minute. Deveney soon caught the eye for his dribbling ability, a not uncommon strength for a player who is close to the ground, and so it was somewhat surprising that it was with a header that he won it for Mervue in extra-time. \n\nThe Galway side are now through to the quarter-finals and could progress further as they are a good side, with creative central midfielders in Neravan and David Sheridan, strong runners in wide players Charlie Flipe and Tony Lupe and a clever number 10 in Calvin Tore. \n\nBallingarry’s FAI Youths odyssey has come to an end but they still have everything to play for on the domestic front. In the Cup competitions, they are through to the semi-finals of the Desmond Youths Cup and have yet to begin their Youths Division 1 League Cup campaign. They will be crowned League Champions if they win their last two league games.  The more difficult of the two is undoubtedly the match at home to leaders Broadford United but succeeding in that challenge is definitely within their compass if they can maintain the intensity and quality that they produced in the first-half against Mervue and if they get the same level of enthusiastic support as was evident last Sunday.\nBalllingarry: Keith O’Kelly, Kieran Storin, Ciaran Tagney, Adam Long, Luke Flynn, Cian Kirwan, Josh Quille, Garrett Sparling, Mike Molly, Mark Hayes, Dylan Singh.

Starting very brightly they were in control for large periods of the first half taking the lead after 4 minutes following a great run and finish by Jack McMahon. A free kick after some trickery by Kieran Long just outside the box was spilled by the keeper with Liam Molloy first to react to make it 2 nil. Breska threatened a few times but the home defence were on top with Thomas Moran and David Moloney in great form. On 22 minutes Daniel Magner got on the end of a corner to leave it 3-0 at the break. \n\nThe second half started in similar fashion to the first with Ballingarrys boys picking up the pace. They knew that they would need to keep their concentration as Breska would come out strong looking for the goals that would see them back in the game. Cillian McMahon kept things going in midfield to ensure Ballingarry stayed focused. James Meehan scored on 31 mins after some fine work down the left by Cathal Markham. Credit to Breska who never gave up and created some chances where Milo Kane in goal was called into action. Up front Rudi Picha ensured the Breska defense didnt get ant time to rest with constant pressure. ",

The opposition started strongly putting pressure on the home back line. This didn’t last as Ballingarry took control and dominated large periods of the first half without creating any clear cut chances.\n\nThe second half started in the same vein and the home side were rewarded with a goal after just two minutes from James Meehan. The quality of football being played was a joy to watch and appreciated by all the spectators. While Ballingarry created more chances they were unable to finish in the net due to in part some fine saves by the opposition keeper.\n\nCredit to Abbeyfeale who never gave up and got the equaliser with the last kick of the game to leave Ballingarry very disappointed boys after a tremendous display of football.\n\n<strong>U12 Boys Div. 4</strong> - Ballingarry B 2 (OG, Bernie) Granagh Utd 1\n \nThe B team were in action straight after the A game. This time at home to local rivals Granagh United. In an even affair they found themselves 1 down after a converted free kick just outside the box. This setback spurred the Ballingarry lads into action and they were on top for the remainder of the first half with their superiority rewarded with a goal before the break from a corner which was deflected into the net. \n\nThe second half was even enough but overall Ballingarry were slightly the stronger side and got the deserved winner from a late Billy Bernie strike with only minutes left on the clock\n\n<strong>Sunday March 24th.</strong>\n\n<strong>Desmond Cup Rd. 2</strong> - Broadford Utd 1 Ballingarry 0\n\nA second half strike saw Ballingarry bow out of the Desmond cup at Broadford.\nTeam: O'Grady, Healy, Fitz, Quinlivan, Flynn, Moore, Forde, J O'Connor, A O'Connor, Smith, Laffan.\nUsed Subs: O'Kelly, Quille, Ling, Cahill.",

It remained 1 nil to half time even though the visitors created some good chances and were unlucky not to score. \n\nIn the second half Broadford were more competitive and were rewarded with a deserved equaliser shortly after the break. It was a very close hard fought game from there on until Cathal McMahon hit the post and Jack Mullane finished the rebound to the net to make it 2.1 with 10 minutes left to play. Unfortunately a dubious refereeing decision with time almost up led to their equaliser and deprived Ballingarry of the win. \n\nA good all round performance with a special mention to Ballingarrys subs for waiting patiently on the side line in the bitter cold for their chance to play.\n\n<strong>Thursday April 4th</strong>\n\n<strong>U/16 Boys Div 1</strong> - Ballingarry 6 (Geary 3, Bridgeman, Kelly, Moran) Shannonside 2\n\n<strong>Sunday April 7th</strong>\n\n<strong>Premier Division</strong> - Ballingarry 2 (A O'Connor, Singh) Rathkeale 3\nA stirring second half performance that saw Ballingarry cancel out a 2-0 half time deficit wasn't enough as Rathkeale found a third late on to secure the points.

Pierce 83) Ballingarry (1)1 (G. Sparling 40) (aet Broadford won 5-3 pens)\n\n[singlepic id=2156 w=150 h=100 float=left]Broadford United emulated last season’s achievement of winning the Youths Division 1 League and League Cup double when they came from behind to beat Ballingarry 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the League Cup Final in Mick Hanley Park on Saturday evening. Ballingarry had the better chances in an evenly-contested opening quarter but Broadford began to gain a slight edge from around the midway point of the first-half. Therefore, it came somewhat against the run of play when Ballingarry opened the scoring in the 40th minute. From five yards inside the opposition half, Adam Long floated a free-kick into the box. It wasn’t defended well and dropped to Garret Sparling, who met it on the bounce and drilled past goalkeeper Mark Kelly from close range.\n\nBallingarry would have doubled their lead six minutes into the second-half but for Kelly making a great double save from Kian Kirwan and Dylan Singh. As time wore on, it looked as if one goal would be enough but then, in the 83rd minute, Broadford equalised. From the centre of midfield, Conor Stack delivered a diagonal ball to the left, where it was met by the inrushing Jack Pierce, whose strike from eight yards gave goalkeeper Keith Kelly no chance. \nBallingarry had a chance to regain the lead in the 88th minute but Kelly saved from Sparling, who fired over from the rebound. Kelly came to Broadford’s rescue again in the first minute of extra-time, making another fine save from Sparling. \n\nIn the shoot-out, the first pair of kicks were to prove decisive. Stack scored for Broadford but Sparling fired over. Both sides were successful with their next two kicks, substitute Colm Ryan and skipper James Molyneaux for Broadford, Luke Ryan and Michael Molloy for Ballingarry. Pierce then put Broadford 4-2 ahead, which meant that Ballingarry had to score their fourth to stay in the contest. It was taken by goalkeeper Kelly and he showed his previous experience as a top-class striker by converting confidently. The pressure of securing victory was now on Jamie Keane’s shoulders as he made his way to the spot but he had confidence in his technique and he drilled unstoppably into the bottom left-hand corner.\n\nBroadford’s exuberant celebrations at the end of the shoot-out were probably down to relief as much as anything else, knowing that they had got out of jail in this one. They lacked their usual cutting edge throughout the game, with striker Keane basically living on scraps. Their passing was often not to their usual high standard and it was for bucking the trend in this regard, as well as yet again showing the positional sense that marks him as a midfielder to watch, that Kieran O’Flynn was selected as Man of the Match.\n\nFor his afore-mentioned saves, Mark Kelly also came into the Man of the Match reckoning, which indicates that Ballingarry created more chances throughout the game. In the 17th minute, Michael Molloy was whistled back for a free in as he bore down on goal when Ballingarry would have preferred the application of the advantage rule. Five minutes later, Sparling fired wide at the far post from a curling delivery by Singh but he had no problem in finding the target when he opened the scoring in the 40th minute.\n\nBroadford’s only shot on target in the first-half came in the 37th minute when Pierce’s free-kick was turned around the post by Kelly. The League Champions showed greater penetration in the second-half and had three chances before Pierce’s late equaliser. TJ Kelly fired over on the turn from a pass by Stack and headed wide from a cross by Ciaran O’Sullivan, while Jack Mullane’s header from Pierce’s free-kick was deflected for a corner. \nThe Broadford management team of Patrick Stack, Ray Keane and Micheal Brosnan were proactive in Broadford’s comeback. In the 80th minute, they went with three at the back, getting left-back Darragh Ryan, who had a fine game throughout, to push forward. This formation lasted the three minutes it took to score the equaliser and then they reverted to 4-4-1-1 again. \n\nThe Broadford management have done a great job this season and that can also be said of Ballingarry manager Dean Clancy and his father, John, who is his assistant. It is their misfortune that they have come up against a winning machine in this Broadford side. The Clancys can be proud of the performances of their charges last Saturday, especially the hard-working displays of midfielders Josh Mulcaire and Sparling and the attacking contributions of Singh, Molloy and Kirwan.\n\nHaving lost out to Broadford in the League and League Cup, Ballingarry still have one more chance of a trophy this season. They are away to Abbeyfeale United in the Desmond Cup semi-final on Saturday and if they win that they will meet Broadford in the final.\n\nSo Broadford are now just one game away from the treble that they just missed out on last season. All Broadford supporters would love to see yet another trophy being presented to skipper James Molyneaux, who was a commanding figure in the heart of defence last Saturday despite just returning from an injury lay-off, but the players and management will realise that they can’t keep relying on prevailing in shoot-outs and that they will have to return to the levels seen earlier in the season.\n\nBroadford United: Mark Kelly, Jack Brennan, Darragh Ryan, Jack Mullane, James Molyneaux, Ciaran O’Sullivan, Kieran O’Flynn, Conor Stack, Jack Pierce, TJ Kelly, Jamie Keane.

Ballingarry started very brightly and were one up inside the first minute with a strike from Katie Lawlee. With the girls playing great possession football they were rewarded with a second coming from Abbie Clancy. While they were in control for large parts, great credit to Broadford who never gave up. A break down the left wing resulted in a free for Broadford. From the free kick and a great save, Broadford were quickest to react and brought the score to 2-1. Half time 2-1. From the half time kick off Broadford went straight on the attack. With the home defence called into action on a few occasions keeping  the opposition threat at bay. With the score still at 2-1 a Lucy Fitzgibbon free kick outside the box was latched onto by Nessa Markham who scored with a volley. A second from Abbie Clancy midway through the second half made it 4-1. Further goals from Donna Kenny and a second from Nessa Markham before the final whistle. A great team display from start to finish.",

        "content:encoded": "<strong>U12 Boys Div 4</strong> - Vang Hat-trick Seals Points - Ballingarry B 4 (Vang 3, O Keeffe 1) AK Utd C 3\n\nOn a lovely Summer's evening Ballingarry U12 b team played AK United C in a thrilling div 4 home tie. Despite Ballingarry dominating possession, hitting the bar twice and failing to finish numerous goal chances United took the lead on 15 minutes. A great finish from Paddy O'Keefe levelled the score 5 minutes later. \nSoon afterwards Marcus Vang scored with a really composed finish from an O'Keeffe and Picha well worked move to put Ballingarry 2.1 up. Again against the run of play the visitors counter attacked and scored from only their 2nd chance of the half. 2 all the break! \nAK started the second well and played with real conviction and new belief for long periods early in the 2nd half and deserved to take​the lead for the second time in match making it 2-3 on 45 minutes!  Ben Daly then took command of centre mid and created some fantastic moves and played Marcus Vang through on 48 minutes, with Vang finishing superbly beating the last defender. 3 all! United continued to look dangerous on the counter attacked but Ryan Aylmer and James long made several last minute tackles to keep the boys in green and gold in the hunt for a winner. Again Daly played a superb through Ball to provide Vang with a chance on goal for a possible winner. A shimmy to the left then right made the keeper commit and Marcus Vang coolly slotted home to give his team the lead 4-3!! Ballingarry went on to hit the bar and from then on defending from the front by consistent early pressure on the opposition defence. The final whistle blew after 3 nervy injury time minutes! What a game. \n\n<strong>Thursday, May 2nd</strong>\n\n<strong>U/16 Boys League Div. 1</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (Molloy) Newcastle West Town 1 \n\n<strong>Sunday May 5th</strong>\n<strong>Premier Div</strong> - Ballingarry 3 (Fitz, J O Connor, K Laffan)  Carrig Celtic 0\n\nBallingarry gave themselves a fighting chance of Premier survival with this vital win against fellow strugglers Carrig Celtic. Brian Fitzgeralds first goal of the season set the home side on their way with Josh O Connor adding a second on the stroke of half time. A third form Kevin Laffan early in the second half sealed the points.\nTeam: O Kelly, Quinlivan, Flynn, Fitzgerald, J O Connor, K Laffan, C Laffan, Costello, Cahill, Hayes, A O Connor.\nUsed subs: Quille, Long, Healy.",

        "content:encoded": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">July 30th 2019 Mick Hanley Park</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Broadford United (2)…………………………………………………..2\n(C. Ryan 17, 41)\nBallingarry (1)………………………………………………………….1\n(M. Hayes 7)</p>\n&nbsp;\nBroadford United completed the Youths treble in Mick Hanley Park on Tuesday night of last week when they beat Ballingarry 2-1 in the Desmond Youths Cup Final, thus adding to the Division 1 League and Division 1 League Cup won earlier in the season. It is a fantastic achievement by Broadford but hard luck on Ballingarry who finished runners-up in all three competitions. \n\nMark Hayes, Ballingarry’s best player, opened the scoring in the 7th minute but Colm Ryan equalised ten minutes later and then scored a brilliant winner from 30 yards in the 41st minute. Not surprisingly, Ryan was chosen as Man of the Match. \nHaving just pipped Ballingarry to the league title and only beaten them on penalties in the League Cup Final, Broadford knew that they would be in for a tough battle in their bid to complete the treble that just eluded them last season when they were beaten by Newcastle West in the Desmond Youths Cup Final. \n\nThe difficulty of the task was confirmed with Ballingarry’s 7th minute opener. Andrew Meade played a diagonal ball to Hayes on the right. Goalkeeper Mark Kelly elected to come off his line to narrow Hayes’s options but one option was all that Hayes needed and that was to guide the ball first-time past the advancing Kelly and into the empty net. \nThe lead lasted ten minutes. A good passing move finished with Jamie Keane setting up Ryan, who rocketed to the middle of the goals from 20 yards. \n\nIt was fitting that the teams were level at the end of an evenly-contested opening quarter but Broadford gained an edge in the last fifteen minutes of the half. Ciaran O’Sullivan came close from a left-wing cross by Jack Brennan before Ryan gave Broadford the lead with one of the best goals seen in Mick Hanley Park. Receiving a pass from Conor Stack with his back to goal, Ryan turned smartly and then sent a 30-yard screamer zooming into the top left-hand corner. It was poetry in motion and drew hearty cheers of appreciation from the Broadford supporters. \nBroadford stayed on top for the remaining minutes of the half. Dangerous crosses from Keane and Pierce just failed to reach O’Sullivan and Keane, respectively, while O’Sullivan’s slight connection with Ryan’s clever back-heel in injury-time drew a save from Keith O’Kelly. \n \nThe Broadford management team of Patrick Stack and Ray Keane brought on TJ Kelly for O’Sullivan. Kelly slotted into the centre of midfield, where he proved to be influential, with Stack moving to the right. Within a minute of his introduction, Kelly headed over from a cross by Ryan and Broadford threatened to add to their lead again two minutes later when skipper James Molyneaux’s header from stack’s corner was blocked in a crowded goalmouth. \n\nBallingarry then enjoyed a good 15-minute spell in which they made most of the running. Luke Flynn headed over from a sideline free-kick by fellow centre-half Adam Long; Garrett Sparling’s shot from Meade’s corner was blocked en route to goal; a 25-yard shot from Hayes produced a tremendous save from Kelly, palming it over for a corner by Meade, from which Sparling headed over; and attacking full-back Kieran Storan was denied by the advancing Kelly as he raced onto a through ball from Meade. \n\nBroadford tried to crowd out Hayes as much as possible but, in the 62nd minute, it was the sheer speed of Molyneaux that prevented Hayes from bearing down on goal when he beat the striker in a foot race to a through ball. That was just one snippet in another typically commanding performance in the heart of the defence by Molyneaux. \n\nHaving weathered Ballingarry’s spell of pressure, it was Broadford who created the game’s remaining chances. Pierce’s shot from a pass by Kelly drew a super save from O’Kelly; Pierce and Ryan both fired over from passes by Keane; and Ryan almost completed his hat-trick from a tight angle in the 87th minute. To score a hat-trick in a Desmond Youths Cup Final would have been a special achievement for Ryan but he was still a clear winner of the Man of the Match award, for the quality of his link-up play and the brilliance of his second goal. \n\nBroadford’s delight in completing the treble was evident at the final whistle. They really are a special bunch of players, the club having won seven of the eight trophies available in the Limerick Desmond League at Youths and u-17 level over the last two seasons. They are a credit to managers Stack and Keane and it must also be said that Ballingarry did all that could be asked of them over the season for their manager Dean Clancy and his father, John, who was his assistant.\n\nBroadford United: Mark Kelly, Jack Brennan, Darragh Ryan, Jack Mullane, James Molyneaux, Ciaran O’Sullivan, Conor Stack, Kieran O’Flynn, Jack Pierce, Colm Ryan, Jamie Keane.

United opened the better putting the winners under some early pressure but it was Ballingarry who went the closest when Kenny was just wide after Fitzgibbon crossed from the right. Once Ballingarry went one up after five minutes they took control. Amy Madden made a powerful run from midfield, a feature of her game throughout and one reason why she was awarded player of the game, before driving the ball into the box where Abbie Clancy finished from close in. Ballingarry dominance was rewarded after 14 minutes when Donna Kenny sent a beautiful effort to the top corner from just inside the box. This ended a fine passing move involving O Keeffe, Markham and Kenny herself. Ballingarry were now in control but United responded and a well struck effort from 20 yards deceived Quinn in goal to give Broadford hope. It was the only setback on another fine performance from the Ballingarry keeper.\n\n[ngg_images gallery_ids=\"203\" display_type=\"photocrati-nextgen_basic_thumbnails\"]\n\nBroadford hope was to be short lived however as a two goal burst from the winners in the final five minutes of the half all but secured the cup for Ballingarry. First Amy Madden scored a fine goal following neat passing from Madigan, Rebecca Fitzgibbon and Markham, whose linkup play at midfield through control and pass was central to most Ballingarry moves. Abbie Clancy’s second on the stroke of half time gave Ballingarry a comfortable cushion. Again it was the product of a marvellous passing move which started at the back with Sarah Lynch, O Keeffe, Markham and finally Lucy Fitzgibbon whose perfect cross was met at the far post by Clancy.\n\nThe second half saw Ballingarry come into their own with some really impressive passing moves. Madden was just wide with two efforts before she finally got her second. Ballingarry had broke at pace from Madigan’s early out ball, Lucy Fitzgibbon latched on and her stinging effort drew a fine fingertip save from the keeper. The resultant corner from the left was partially cleared to land perfectly for Madden to strike a glorious fifth on the half volley from 18 yards. Ballingarry could have had more but it was left to Katie Lawlee, who had a fine game throughout, to have the final saw against her former team mates when she rounded off a move involving Emma McNamara and Donna Kenny with time almost up.\n\nThe score line was somewhat unfair on Broadford who in spite of the score line gave Ballingarry a real test, but this Ballingarry team are a special outfit who never fail to impress. They play a passing game in all parts of the pitch from back to from with the emphases always on forward play some of which is spellbinding. There is no visible weakness with all the girls comfortable on the ball and familiar with their roles, this also applies to the subs used on the day, Cunningham, O Sullivan, Hartigan and McNamara all played their part when required. This does not happen by accident and credit must go the coaches Shane Markham and Micky Mac for the philosophy employed and clearly visible.\n\nTeam: Quinn, Madigan, O Keeffe, R Fitzgibbon, Lynch. Markham, Madden, Kenny, Lawlee, L Fitzgibbon, Clancy.\nUsed Subs: O Sullivan, Hartigan, McNamara, Cunningham.\n\n<strong>Munster Junior Cup Round 1</strong> - Ballingarry 1 (J O Connor) Adare Utd 2\nBallingarry left a half time lead, given to them by Josh O'Connor, to lose 2.1 to visiting Adare United to see their interest in the Munster junior cup end at the first hurdle.\n\n<strong>Ladies Premier Division</strong> - Ballingarry 2 (Shire, Kelly) Breska Rovers 0\n\n",

Ballingarry were unlucky not to be further ahead through some great play in that first half with Emma Condron and Clodagh Morrissey in particular unlucky not to score. The home side were much stronger in the second period. However in spite of fine performances from Michella Enright and Muireann O'Sullivan Ballingarry conceded. The goal spurred Ballingarry to life but try as they might they could not find a way past the home defence and in the end had to settle for a draw.\n\n<strong>U14 Boys Division 2</strong> - Ballingarry v Athea Utd (No show Athea)\n<strong>U16 Girls</strong> - Askeaton 1 Ballingarry 4 (Madden 2; Moran; Hayes)\nThe scoreline suggests an easy win for Ballingarry however this was not the case as Askeaton gave Ballingarry a game throughout. The home side could have been 2 down before they took the lead through Amy Maddens first of two, even then Askeaton fought back and drew level shortly after  the break. Another from Madden and one each from Hannah Moran and Sarah Hayes secured the win that sees the title decided in the last game of the season when Abbeyfeale United visit Ballingarry.\n\n<strong>Youths Division 1</strong> - Ballingarry 0 Abbeyfeale Utd 2\nThe scoreline offers little insight into the game as Ballingarry dominated for long stretches of play in both halves. A missed penalty from the home side at 0-0 changed the landscape from a Ballingarry perspective raising the visitor’s spirits enough to score an unlikely opener. The second came late as Ballingarry surged forward.\n\n<strong>Sunday, October 20th</strong>\n\n<strong>U/14 Girls</strong> - Abbeyfeale Utd 2 Ballingarry 6 (Clancy 2, Lawlee 4)\nBallingarry secured the division 1 title with a game to spare, to go with the u14 cup already won with this emphatic win at Abbeyfeale last Sunday. Another impressive show from the girls in Green and Gold had them 2 up, both goals from Abbie Clancy, before Katie Lawlee took over adding all remaining 4 goals. Congratulations to the squad and management on secureing a first ever “double” for the clubs Under 14 girls.",

Ballingarry took to lead through Mike Molloy first of two only to sloppily let it slip before the break but a commanding second half performance saw three unanswered goals from Molloy again, Darragh Casey and David Geary to see them play Itas away in round 3.\n\n<strong>Sunday, October 27th</strong>\n<strong>U16 Girls</strong> - Ballingarry 6 (Lawlee 4, Kenny, Madden) Abbeyfeale Utd 3\n[singlepic id=2202 w=150 h=100 float=left][singlepic id=2203 w=150 h=100 float=right]Ballingarry had to come from behind twice to seal their first ever U16 girls league title pipping Abbeyfeale United in the final game of the season. It was the manner in which they responded to going behind in such a crucial game that impressed the most. Two goals down in the first quarter, an own goal and a scrappy second, would have seen a lesser outfit crumble but not this particular side. They stuck to their principles which is a possession game using the entire pitch content to be patient knowing that chances will come. And they did come. Donny Kenny cut the deficit when she pounced following a spill by the keeper and the Katie Lawlee swept home an equaliser. Abbey responded well going ahead again with a powerfully headed third before Ballingarry replied for a third time with Lalee them finisher after magnificent work from Madden.\n\nA breath-taking first half ended all square. The second half was Ballingarry at their best. Lawlee put them ahead when she slotted inside the post just after the re start. Her third soon followed before a deflected Amy Madden effort flew in over the keeper before Katie Lawlee rounded a staring performance with her fourth and Ballingarrys sixth five from time.\n\nWhile the first half was an exciting and even encounter the second half was sheer brilliance form the winners. Their defence came into their own after a shaky start while the mid field took total control against a physically stronger opponent. Their ability to pass and go is truly a delight with few if any team in the league capable of managing. Katie Lawlee was drafted into this game as a late replacement and what a response. Four goals in her first U 16 game.\n\nCaptain Houlihan was solid as ever receiving superb cover from Flynn and later Moran, McMahon and Chloe O Keefe, O Shea and Dalton. At midfield Markham, Amy O Keeffe, Madden and Mullane dominated and produced when needed while Kenny and Lawlee and when introduced Dawn O Shaughnessy were also superb driving at the opposition relentlessly. Ballingarry have now claimed the U12, 14 and 16 league titles. The under 14 cup resided in Ballingarry also while both the 12s and 16s await their respective cup finals. Unprecedented success has already been realised, is there more to follow?\n\n<strong>Ladies Premier.</strong> - Breska Rovers 0 Ballingarry 5 (Noonan 2, Mulcaire, Shanagher, Moloney)",

This goal almost from an identical set piece from the opposite end of the pitch to the goal that gave Avenue the lead sixteen minutes into the game. Before that opener Ballingarry saw Molloy strike the crossbar and Quill draw a superb save from the visiting keeper.\nThen the lead goal from a brilliantly placed free kick form twenty yards out from the right of the box. It was a goal that gave them a half time lead and while Ballingarrys approach work was better the United’s it was still Avenue that went the closest with two efforts that flew past both Molloys posts.\nThe second half was a different story with Ballingarry coming into their own. Geary will be disappointed not to have equalised form point blank after Madigan set up the chance, this just before Mike Molloy got the all-important first Ballingarry goal. A free was awarded for a hand ball and Molloy drove home for 20 yards. It took two more minutes for Ballingarry to forge ahead. A fine flowing move saw Geary cross from left to right where the impressive Lee Madigan headed home form six yards. Tagney missed to seal the deal before Storin made a superb tackle to deny the visitors. Then the goal that sent the tie to extra time.\nThe first period was just 4 minutes in when Ballingarrys progress to host Douglas Hall was sealed and again it was Mike Molloy who stroked the ball home from the edge of the box.

        "content:encoded": "<strong>Saturday November 30th</strong>\n\n[singlepic id=2224 w=150 h=100 float=left][singlepic id=2225 w=150 h=100 float=right]<strong>U/14 Boys Div 2</strong> - Rathkeale 1 Ballingarry 5 (Kelliher 2, Horgan, McMahon, Picard)\nThe title race went right to the wire with the winner of this clash claiming the laurels. In fact Ballingarry needed just to draw to finish top but that was never going to be an option as Ballingarry ran out easy winners at the finish. Two goals from Billy Kelliher and one each from Cathal McMahon; Adam Picard and Eoin Horgan saw Ballingarry finish with a flourish. Congratulations to Anthony McMahon and his squad.\n\n<strong>FAI Youth Cup Round 3</strong> - Ballingarry 0 Douglas Hall (CDSL) 3\nSet pieces were Ballingarrys undoing as the better team went through on the day. An own goal after just five minutes had Ballingarry reeling when the ball was delivered from the left. Two good saves from Molloy kept Ballingarry in the game however two goals within minutes on either side of halftime sealed their fate. \nThe first on the stroke of the break was bundled over form a corner and the third five minutes after the restart from another dead ball this time from the right which was powerfully headed home from the edge of the box.\nBallingarry had two really good chances to force themselves back into the game however Mike Molloy touch deserted him at the vital moment and David Geary missed from six yards. \n\n<strong>Sunday, December 1st</strong>\n\n<strong>U/16 Girls Cup Final</strong> - Ballingarry 6 (Mullane 3, Madden, Hayes, Lawlee) \t\t\tAskeaton 0 (Mick Hanley Park)\n\n[singlepic id=2222 w=150 h=100 float=left]Ballingarrys trophy crop continues to thrive with this the eight gong of a highly successful season. And with it an unprecedented underage girls clean sweep with this U16 cup now residing with the U12, U14 and now U16 girls doubles. Simply incredible.\nBallingarry were always red hot favourites to lift the cup but still they found it difficult to break down a committed and organised Askeaton defence. Donna Kenny had the ball in the net after five minutes but was ruled offside. However Ballingarry went ahead after 7 minutes. The goal all about powerful running form Amy Madden who after being put away by Ashling Daltons fine pass, finished in the tightest on angles at the keepers right post. In fairness to Askeaton they did threaten on the break and on more than one occasion O Shea, McMahon and Moran had to be at their best to divert the very real danger and even then Houlihan had to come from her line to clear when a goal looked a possibility.\n[singlepic id=2221 w=150 h=100 float=right]Ballingarry would get the comfort of a second goal 26 minutes. Hannah Morans superb pass out from the back found Anna Mullane and after a neat interchange with Amy O Keeffe she slipped the centre half to drive home. It was the first of her three.\nThe second half was just six minutes in when Ballingarry got their third. Some beautiful passing from Nessa Markham, voted player of the match for her tireless running and intelligent play throughout, and Molly McCarthy sent Sarah Hayes away down the left to finish beautifully to the far corner. Hayes the scorer became provider seven minutes later when her deft touch put Anna Mullane in to for her second.\nKatie Lawlee was introduced and in the space of fifteen minutes managed to hit the post twice and score a real cracker when in her trade mark manner cut in from the left to strike.  Mullane was the instigator of this Lawlee goal. At that point it was left to Captain Mullane to complete the scoring and indeed her hat trick with Ballingarrys sixth on the stroke of full time.\n[singlepic id=2223 w=150 h=100 float=left]This was not a vintage Ballingarry performance but still impressive. The back four of O Shea, McMahon, Moran and Dalton and later O Shaughnessy, while not always in control were always prepared to regain control and this they did at all times. Their willingness and bravery to play out from the back had to be admired. The engine room, mid field, is exactly that. Mullanes runs yielded 3 goals while the same feature lies within Amy Madden, remember the first goal? Markham’s energy and vision makes her a player of the match contender in most games, today was one of those days when her quality was recognised. The wide players Amy O Keeffe and Donna Kenny give most full backs enough to do to stop them doing anything other than defend and then Katie Lawlee arrives to torment further. Sarah Hayes finished and created a goal, there is no more can be expected from a number 9. On the day the cover released from the bench would be starters in every team in our league, Chloe O Keeffe, Emily Flynn, Dawn O Shaughnessy, Molly McCarthy and Katie Lawlee, a flawless squad.\nQuite a few of these girls have already won the double with the U14s however special mention to Katie Lawlee who has won the lot from U12 to U16 in her first season with the club.\nCongratulations also to Micky Mac and Shane Markham and Martha O Connor for the many hours put into the preparation that have the rest looking on in wonder.\n\n<strong>Premier Division</strong> - Glin Rovers 2 Ballingarry 0\nTeam: O Grady; Long; Flynn; Quinlivan; Fitzgerald; Lenihan; Ryan; R O Shea; S O Shea; Clancy; Meade.\nUsed subs: J O Connor; A O Connor; Tagney; Forde.\n",

        "content:encoded": "Most people with an interest in Soccer and living in Ballingarry will know of the connection between the West Limerick village and Hibernian FC in Edinburgh, which is one of Scotland’s biggest football clubs. Weaving this connection together there is a fascinating story about one man's crusade to tackle social and cultural issues of the poorer Catholic’s in the city of Edinburgh during the second half of the 19th century.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9979\" src=\"http://ballingarryafc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CanonHannon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"212\">Hibernian or Hibs as they are commonly known as were formed in 1875 by <strong>Canon Edward Joseph Hannan</strong> who was born in Ballingarry in 1836 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1860. Following his ordination he travelled to Edinburgh in 1861 on holiday and was persuaded to stay by the bishop to run the recently re-inaugurated&nbsp;St Patrick’s&nbsp;parish church. During his long period in Edinburgh he did much to address the social problems of the poorer Catholics in the city and founded a local branch of the Catholic Young Men’s Society (CYMS) in 1865, which had been founded in Ireland by his uncle, Monsignor Richard B. O'Brien.\n\nIn 1871 he became the priest in charge at St Patrick’s. He did much for the inhabitants of \"Little Ireland\", the Irish community in Edinburgh, centred around the&nbsp;Cowgate&nbsp;area. In 1875, together with the 21 year old Michael Whelahan of the CYMS, and in part to mark the centenary of&nbsp;The Liberator Daniel O'Connell's birth, he founded&nbsp;Hibernian Football Club.\n\nHannan served as the club's first Manager and as President until his death. Despite only starting as a church club, Canon Hannan did much lobbying resulting in acceptance of the team playing for the Scottish Cup in 1877, only two years after their foundation. He lived in the house attached to St Patrick’s Church. He died of pneumonia on the 24th of June 1891.\n\n[ngg src=\"galleries\" ids=\"211\" display=\"basic_thumbnail\" thumbnail_crop=\"0\"]\n\nOn Friday January 24th, 2020, five members of St Patricks Hibernian supporters branch, Dougie McLeod, Paddy Power, Stuart McLeod, Brian Duffy &amp; Willie Wilson visited Ballingarry. Here they discussed with Ballingarry AFC, represented by John Cronin, Marie Quaid, Paschal Moynihan and James Clancy, their proposed presentation of a replica mosaic plague, its original significance of the iconic badge and, the original plaque that had been located above the Easter Road Main Entrance of Hibs FC since time remembered. The Harp proclaiming the Clubs Irish routes and the now&nbsp;main reason on returning the iconic Hibernian Harp to its founding fathers’ birthplace, Ballingarry.\n\nDuring discussions which were extremely productive and are ongoing, there was a general agreement that this project will proceed and to target completion, most likely in September 2021. The visiting party were taken on a tour of the locality on Saturday January 25th where they visited local places of interest.\n\nUpdates will be posted as the project develops.",

        "content:encoded": "<strong>February 23rd 2020 - Munster Youth Cup Semi Final</strong> - Carrigaline United 3 Ballingarry 3 aet (Storin; OG; Quill) Ballingarry win 4-2 on penalties.\n\nBallingarry will revisit a stage that has eluded them for almost twenty years when they face Bridge United of Clare in the Munster Youth Cup semi- final. An epic game in Cork against Carrigaline United, the holders, offered everything including a penalty shootout that saw Ballingarry prevail.\n\nNot since 2002 have Ballingarry experienced such dizzy Munster heights when they faced and lost to another Cork opponent Douglas Hall at Turners Cross in the penultimate stage however, Ballingarry will be hoping that they can go one step further when they host Clare side Bridge United at the end of March.\nFollowing a shaky opening fifteen minutes during which the home side dominated indeed scoring from the first corner of the game after just five minutes when their 6 foot 4 inch centre half headed in at the back post, Ballingarry settled and the game developed into an exciting even affair. \n\nIn fairness but for two magnificent saves from Mike Molloy in goal for Ballingarry the game could have been lost by the break. The first after seventeen minutes when his point blank block denied a certain goal and again on 31 minutes when he finger tipped a 30 yard blockbuster onto the crossbar. In between Gearys free delivered into the box saw the homesides keeper deny Casey with an excellent save. Another delivery from Geary from a corner evaded everyone to drift out at the far side for a throw, any touch would have yielded a goal. Ballingarry were threatening and will be wondering how they didn’t go in at the break level when Madigans free from the left  was met by Casey but his header was brilliantly saved by the keeper only for the ball to fall to Kieran Storin but with the goal at his mercy he somehow blazed wide. He would make up for this miss in spades in the second half.\n\nThe second half started with the visitors on top and another glorious chance went a begging when a beautiful layoff from Geary put Mike Southgate clean through but the keeper did superbly in coming off his line to save, still Southegate will be disappointed. United went two up just 4 minutes into the half . A long ball was delivered from left to right where their forward half turned and shot in the one move to provide the two goal cushion.\n\nBallingarry responded in truly wonderful fashion scoring the all important next goal just eight minutes into a hectic second half. Geary delivered the corner, a game of pin ball ensued with the keeper saving bravely before Storin drove to the net. A massive goal at a crucial time. In the space of two minutes in the 60th and 62nd Ballingarry scored twice to go ahead. Quills driven corner from the left was too hot for the keeper to hold when it struck his chest and rebounded onto the post and into the net, an own goal for sure, the second put Ballingarry ahead and it was Josh Quill who drove home to the delight of his team mates from the edge of the box. As Carrig pushed forward looking for an equaliser they left massive gaps at the back. Ballingarry had chances to seal the game but they found a fine keeper in their way . Casey and Madigan were denied while Geary was off target. United were now all out in search of a passage to extra time. The post was struck on 80 minutes while a superb effort screamed past the far post. Then with just four minutes of normal time remaining the homeside forced extra time. Another corner undone Ballingarry as the ball was driven in at the near post. \n\nExtra time flew by with no real chances leaving penalties to decide. Once Jack Molloy saved the first effort you knew Ballingarry would not miss and progress. M Molloy; Geary; Quill and Tagney were flawless form the spot while Carrigs second pen flew over the bar. \n\nIt would be easy to say penalties are a lottery but are they really? No one from the winners had to volunteer, no one hid at the back to avoid the responsibility, they ran to the spot without fear, this comes from preparation and Ballingarry were prepared, they will be prepared for the semi final as well.\n\nTeam: J Molloy; Tierney; Storin; Tagney; Kelly; Casey; Quill; Southgate; Madigan; M Molloy; Geary.\nUsed Subs: McGoey; Ruddle; \n\n",

But to do so they will first have to overcome a formidable opponent in visiting Bridge United from Sixmilebridge in Clare.\n\nSeveral Desmond clubs have progressed to the penultimate stage in the past including Ballingarry in 2002 but none other than the afore mentioned Glin have graced the final, this Ballingarry side will be desperate to go one step further than that 2002 side and reach the final and face either College Corinthians or Villa who face off in the other semi.\n\nBallingarry have travelled a difficult path to get to this stage and had to win on the road on four of the five rounds to date to secure this home fixture with the Banner men.\n\nGranagh United provided the first test with the added ingredient of a local derby adding spice to a game that Ballingarry won 3-1 with goals from Mike Molloy 2 and Mike Southgate.\n\nNext up were Broadford United who Ballingarry found to be such a difficult opponent at this age group over the past number of seasons. The 4-1 victory at the very least dispensed with the hex that United held over them during those seasons when they pipped Ballingarry in most competitions. On the mark for the winners that day were Mike Molloy with another brace, David Geary and Darragh Casey.\n\nSt Itas predictably provided a stern test in the 3rd round with Ballingarry’s Mile Molloy and David Geary helping Ballingarry to pass that particular exam on a 2-0 scoreline,a victory that saw them in the open draw.\n\nOn to Waterford where their easier that the 2-1 AET scoreline victory would suggest with goals again form Molloy and Kieran Storin setting them up for an epic encounter in Cork against the holders Carrigaline United.\n\nThis game will stand to Ballingarry as they face into this semi-final plus it will have provided an invaluable education to team managers Dean and John Clancy as to the character lurking within this squad.\n\nFinding themselves 2 goals in arrears early in the second half could and in many cases would have seen many a side crumple but not this Ballingarry outfit. They fought back with Storin again on the mark and a first in the competition from Josh Quill with an own goal completing the scoring to level and indeed sent Ballingarry ahead only for the home side to send the game to extra time in the dying moments and when eventually the game needed penalties to decide the boys in Green and Gold displayed courage and character and no little skill in converting their four spot kicks.\n\nManagers Dean and John Clancy will have left nothing to chance in preparing the squad for this game having enrolled experienced coaches Shane Markham and Mike Boyle to assist with the final preparations.\n\nSunday’s game will be an epic historic occasion for the club, unfortunately due to Covid-19 restrictions only 200 people in total will be allowed into the ground with entry by ticket only.\n\nPrediction: This crop of boys in Green and Gold to upstage the class of 2002.",

        "content:encoded": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ballingarry (1) 1 (M Molloy 4 min) Bridge United (0) 0</strong></p>\n\n[ngg src=\"galleries\" ids=\"212\" display=\"basic_thumbnail\"]A glorious Summer’s day at The Paddocks brought a glorious result for Ballingarry as the Green and Gold Munster youth cup dream lives on with the final now awaiting Ballingarry.\nIt was the Desmond Leagues very own Super Sunday with three clubs involved in colossal Munster collisions but it was Ballingarry alone who came through to carry the leagues standard to the next stage and what an occasion it promises to be when they face Villa FC of Waterford for the opportunity to become the first Desmond District Leagues Munster youth cup winners.\nSaturday August 15th is a date for your diary when no doubt the final venue will be awash with Green and Gold.\nIt really was a fine game of football between two very evenly matched sides and while the scoreline rightly suggests a tight fought game Ballingarry were deserving winners as they forged the better chances with trojan performances in all departments. The only goal of the game was scored within the opening five minutes, Bridge could have went ahead when Leon Daly, the smallest but one on the best players on show, with brilliant trickery beat Tierney on the wing to cross where Maxwell forced a fine save from Molloy from a diving header, Molloy’s quick thinking put Reece Kelly away down the left to find Mike Molloy thirty five yards out form goal, spotting the keeper off his line he sent a truly magnificent effort sailing over the stranded Fitzpatrick’s head for a wonder goal. He was 35 yards from goal just four minutes had gone on the click. The battle evolved from here and a real game resulted.\nTwelve minutes in United had an opportunity when Tagney, who was a Herculean captain throughout, fouled Kirkland but the free from Maxwell was well wide .A glorious chance fell United’s way though after fifteen minutes when Dube’s neat cross from the right found Evan O Callaghan unmarked sixteen yards out but he volleyed just over. It was a lucky escape for Ballingarry.\nBallyingarry had forced a number of early corners before the visitors got their first on 22 minutes but is proved an easy save from Molloy in goal who it must be said had an easy game throughout not being forced into any serious save although there was one scary moment in the final minute of the game when he tried to find Geary with a quick clearance only for the ball to strike his own player to rebound back into the box, he recovered well and a lesson no doubt learned.\nThe game was at this point a fast flowing even affair and while Bridge did have slightly more possession Ballingarry were always comfortable with their defence of Tierney, Tagney, Storin and Kelly giving a masterclass in defending, with the two full backs dynamic when attacking. Ballingarry went close to doubling their lead fifteen minutes form the break when following a foul on Madigan, Quill delivered for Molloy to head over. Just before that a lightening break through Casey saw the mid fielder cross from right to left for tireless Geary to shoot wide.\nUnited saw O Callaghan send a long-range effort well over just before the centre half, Storm Devanney, made a tremendous run form his own half but shadowed by Quill all the way ran the ball out, typical marvelous work for Quill. The half ended with the winners on the attack when Geary’s corner came to nothing.\nThe second half was barely in progress when United s Dube, following a deft turn, worked Molloy in goal with the resultant corner fruitless.\nFive minutes into the half came one of the highlights of the game. Molloy’s magic down left channel left Bridge captain Kelly stranded Molloy’s cross had the keeper all at sea and when Casey turned the ball back across the box it seemed the inrushing Adam Hickey must score but somehow left back Luke Shea threw himself at the ball for a an unbelievable block. It was the type of moment that could and probably should have inspired those around him.\nThree corners in quick succession in the 60th minute should have yielded Ballingarry their insurance with the ball skimming the post from both Casey and Tagney.\nCasey was again in the thick of things with a brave block nineteen minutes from time before Geary shot wide when well placed. Casey again could have done better when Madigan’s driven cross from the left found him arriving but again Shea was there to deny Ballingarry. United unloaded the bench as the game neared its end but to no avail and when the final whistle sounded it signaled scenes of real celebration for the Green and Gold.\nAnother tremendous performance from this Ballingarry side following on from the heroics in Cork in the quarter final. Well drilled, well prepared with a desire to win a competition and a belief that some in our league believe can be done. Credit to Dean and John Clancy for the professional approach and Shane Markhan and Mike Boyle for the help over the past few weeks.\nThe final beckons for Ballingarry, has there ever been a bigger sporting occasion for a club from The Garden Town, 36 years the Club has been waiting for a day like this, it has finally arrived.\nCome on You Boys in Green and Gold.

James worked passionately for the club and was instrumental in building it into one of the finest sports clubs and soccer grounds in the country. James’s role as secretary was impeccable, his record keeping and attention to detail was one to behold, he kept stats on every player that ever played for the club down through the years , what they scored and who it was against. He liaised with League delegates from all over and did his job seamlessly in order for the club to run as smooth as possible all while working away quietly in the background, never one to look for praise or recognition for the mammoth work he did. He was the back bone of the club the vein that constantly pumped new energy and enthusiasm for it to flourish and grow . James was a quintessential clubman and was held in very high esteem by all that had the privilege of knowing him, he was always there for everyone in the club , there wasn’t a question that James could not answer and if he couldn’t he would always be there to help find out. He gave an absolute life time of service to the club and will be truly missed .\nAside from the club nothing equalled James’ devout love for his family, his loving wife Maria, his adoring children Megan, Nathan and Abbie who have lost their husband and Dad and to his Mam, Dad, brother John, sisters and extended family our sincerest of sympathy and deepest condolences go out to you during this heartbreaking and difficult time.\nJames we salute you , May your soul rest in peace , fly high above us and we have no doubt you will be looking down over us wishing us nothing but the best !\nAr dheis Dé go raibh a anam",

        "content:encoded": "A cracking Munster youth final that provided all the thrills and spills of a big cup decider was played out on an afternoon where the four seasons all made an appearance in the sunny south east at Ozier Park.\n\nBallingarry and Villa were both looking for that elusive, historic win that would propel them to best youths team in munster, and despite all the pre match nerves the players delivered a hard fought, but fair and very competitive 110 minutes of football.\n\nVilla settled better and Owen Oseri proved a live threat and when he and Salim Ahmed combined Villa threated the opener, but Oseri shot wide and was also denied by a brilliant Tangney block. The suirsiders continued their attacking start and perhaps should have led when Walsh’s cross was met by Jake o Connor who flashed an effort over.\n\nBallingarry settled and composed themselves and started to threaten, the industrious Lee Madigan was yellow carded when he tried to force a foul inside the box and Molloy and Reidy were starting to find gaps , Molloy in particular when he fired wide on 37 minutes, just before Conor Walsh’s free kick edged over the bar.\n\nHalf time 0-0 and this game was in the melting pot.\n\nThe second half was just as tense, two sides, full blooded and not conceding an inch but there were chances. The tricky Oseri waltzed past two players before teeing up Ahmed who was brilliantly denied by Jack Molloy who was commanding his goalmouth brilliantly with his back 4 very resolute in defence.\n\nBallingarry were playing on the counter, Molloy’s quick kick outs were causing problems and from one the Limerick side could have broken the deadlock as Molloy turned his man inside the area only for Searson to save well with his feet.\n\nCiaran Tangney headed wide from a corner and David Geary had an effort saved by Searson while Madigan shot straight at the Villa netminder from 18 yards.\n\nFull time 0-0 and both sides didn’t deserve anything less\n\nExtra time was frenetic, the first period saw Villa force 5 corners, all defended superbly by Ballingarry who’s pre match planning proved to be spot on on the day.\n\nThe game exploded into life in the 2nd period of extra time, 2 goals, 2 red cards but the same outcome, the sides couldn’t be separated.\n\nBallingarry drew first blood, a corner swept in from the left was met by sub Michael Southgate who connected and bundled the ball over the line, there was epic scenes in the stand and in the dugout as Ballingarry dared to dream.\n\nVilla set about an equaliser and threatened immediately, they were rewarded when sub Bassit Ishola brilliantly turned and shot from 10 yards to level the game.\n\nPower and Madigan saw red for two yellows as the game reached boiling point with Viall coming within a whisker of scoring at the death.\n\nNobody wanted this game tio end but penalties were to decide this one, Molloy and Geary put Ballingarry 2-1 up but successive misses gave Villa the upper hand. Mark Ruddle superbly slotted home under pressure but agony awaited as Jake o Connor scored the winning penalty to end Villa’s 61 year wait for the cup.\n\nIt was heartbreak for Ballingarry, their support was vocal and passionate throughout the afternoon, their players gave everything physically and emotionally, the squad were together and perhaps the biggest appreciation should go to the management team – their preparations and game plan were outstanding and they made Ballingarry stand tall on a memorable day that will be forever etched in the club’s history.\n\nBefore the game a minute’s silence was observed impeccably for James Clancy, the weight of the week was there to witness as Villa celebrated in the background but James would have had the widest smile at what he looked down on, the Ballingarry boys had played their hearts out, the outcome not what was desired but despite the result Ballingarry gained many new friends and supporters as they showed they belonged in the big time.\n\nWell done to players, management, backroom team, supporters and club committee – this is only the beginning\n\nBallingarry: Molloy, Tierney, Kelly, Tangney ©&#xfe0f;, Storin, Quille, Casey, Hickey, Geary, Molloy, Madigan, McGoey, Southgate, Leahy, Ruddle, McMahon, Lawlor, Sheehy",

        "content:encoded": "As a grassroots club we aim to improve standards both on and off the field. While on the field development is important, it is equally as important to ensure the correct structures are in place behind the scenes. Through achieving the Club Mark Award in 2018 we are demonstrating our commitment to having proper governance and management structures within our club to achieve this. Club Mark helps to ensure that our club is organised in all areas of management. \n\nThe next stage of the FAI Club Mark Award is the One Star. This will provide an additional focus and support in all areas of coaching & player development. Ballingarry AFC are one of only 23 clubs who have been successful in the initial application for the Award. This will also help when applying for funding for development. \n\nOur club is run by volunteers who play an invaluable role in the development of football for all in our community. As a club we are committed to ensuring that all our coaches and volunteers have the knowledge to promote football and develop our players. \n\nWe have great volunteers in our club. Our activities do not happen by chance, a great number of people put in huge efforts to maintain our current level of activity. Our coaches and volunteers show great dedication, commitment and loyalty to the club. In the future, we hope that we can expand the number of volunteers and coaches. We want to build this in the years ahead. \n\nBallingarry AFC provides an opportunity for people to get involved in football. The number of participants that get involved and stay involved in a club is determined by many factors. To grow and maintain participation levels, we as a club need to create an open, friendly and safe environment where players can reach their full potential. An effective coaching philosophy in line with the FAI’s Player Development Plan and delivered by our own certified coaches will shape the experience our players will have when playing for Ballingarry AFC. \n\nAs part of the application for the FAI One Star Award the club have restructured the Underage Committee to include a coaching subcommittee. This committee will be tasked with supporting player and coaching development in line with the FAI’s Player development Plan. \n\nA coaching and player development plan recognises that the coaches are key to the future development. Coaches are the engine of improvement in the club. The plan will look beyond the strict confines of coaching and include areas such as facilities, protocols and equipment. \n\nA key component is the upskilling of our coaches so that they can maximise their own potential and by extension the potential of the players in our club. The Club will support and encourage participation in coach education. A lot of the courses can now be completed online via Zoom and are age appropriate for the age-group in which you are coaching. Unlike previous Coach Education Courses, a manager/coach may enter at the age they are coaching.  We will regularly update this group with upcoming courses. \n\nWhen restrictions have been reduced and when safe to do so we will have a meeting to introduce the Club Development Plan. We look forward to working side by side in helping the club achieve this standard. \n\nIf anyone has any queries or wishes to get in contact please do so. You can contact me directly on the number below. \n\nThank you all for your continued cooperation. \n\nShane Markham (086 8181524)\n\nOn behalf of the Underage/Coaching Subcommittee.",

We are the first club in Limerick, the second in Munster and tenth club in the country to receive the award which is a phenomenal achievement.\n\nThe FAI Club Mark One Star means the club is now a Player Development Centre which signifies that Ballingarry AFC has an FAI recognised player development plan, an FAI recognised coaching structure working alongside an FAI Coaching Mentor, has demonstrated best practice in child welfare and safeguarding and has the highest standard in club governance.\n\nWe would like to thank our coaching subcommittee for the incredible amount of work they have done in achieving this award and in particular our Head of Academy Shane Markham for the work he has done in the past few years in first achieving the FAI Club Mark award and now going to the next level and achieving the FAI Club Mark One Star for our club. We would also like to thank Barry McGann for his guidance and assistance over the past couple of months.\n\nThe club is excited for the future of our academy and to improving our players on and off the field.",

Paddy was a great lover of all sports  but  was a lifetime supporter of our club. He could be seen at the Paddocks no matter which age group were taking to the field, monitor the game with his keen and intelligent eye. He’d take up his and only his position under the balcony weekend after weekend to watch his adopted home town club play the beautiful game, an obvious source of pleasure to him. He’s pride watching sons John, Noel and Padraig down through the years was never disguised and later grandsons Kevin Josh and Aaron by taking to the pitch in the green and gold carried on the the strong   association between the Forde family and club.\n\nDaughter Margo and granddaughter Leanne represented their club also which was all witnessed by Paddy. But probably his greatest pride were the exploits of Anthony and his success as a professional footballer. The honour he has brought to his family and especially Paddy was very evident at the very mention of Anthony. We’ll miss you at the Paddocks and our other fiends and supporters of our football family that have past away in recent times. Deepest condolences to his wife Tut, John Noel Padraig Helen and Margo and all his grandchildren and extended family. May he rest in peace.",

They were 1:0 down at HT but 15 mins from time Brian Fitzgerald popped up with a lovely header after a brilliant delivery from Francis Kiely. Neither team could find a winner so penalties were to be the deciding factor. Steven Kelly was the hero of the shootout and saved two penalties to give the B’s the win which will give them great confidence going into the new season.\n\nThe A team now join the 19s and the B team by getting into the 3rd final of the pre season tournament. In a tight game in Abbeyfeale this morning there wasn’t much between the two teams. Cian O Carroll scored a brilliant goal by chipping the keeper from 30 yards. Abbey struck level just before half time to equal the game in what can be said was deserved.\nThe second half was much like the first very tight. Abbey had more of the possession but found it hard to break down the Ballingarry defence. Ballingarry thought they had a penalty with 5 mins to go but to their surprise it was waved away. Again penalties was the only way to separate the teams this morning. Abbey missed their first and fourth penalty and Ballingarry dispatched their first 4 penalties expertly (Kevin Forde, Declan Nash, David Geary and Aaron Smith) to progress to the final.\n\nWell done to both management and teams and best of luck to the 19s and A team next week as they hope to emulate the B teams tournament success.

They showed what they were capable of in the summer tournament by winning all 6 games, scoring 43 goals and only conceding 4.\n\nLast nights result was extremely impressive putting 13 past a very good footballing Kildimo side who were young and will be ones to watch in the future. It was a slow start for both sides, who were trying to scope their opposition out but it was Ballingarry who struck first with a lovely finish by Lee Madigan. Another goal 2 mins later by the head of Eoin Lynch looked to set Ballingarry on their way but when Kildimo pulled one back on 40 mins Ballingarry knew they had to go up a gear to win this game. Up a gear (or two) they did and 2 more goals before half time by Paudie Murphy and Cian McGoey put one hand on the trophy for the green and gold.\n\nThe second half Ballingarry had the luxury of introducing very strong players off the bench and this proved to be the difference between the two teams in the second half. Three substitutes scored 6 goals in the second half, a hat trick by David Geary, two from Cathal McMahon and one from Cian O Carroll. Another from McGoey and two from Mike Molloy finished off the evening of impressive passing and finishing in style.\n\n[ngg src=\"galleries\" ids=\"215\" display=\"basic_thumbnail\" thumbnail_width=\"240\" thumbnail_height=\"160\"]\n\nWith only 4 over age for next years youths and more young talent coming through it makes light reading for the future. &#x1f7e1;&#x1f7e2;&#x1f3c6;\n\nBallingarry AFC 13 - 1 Kildimo\n\nDavid Geary x3\nCathal McMahon x2\nCian McGoey x2\nMike Molloy x2\nCian O Carroll\nPaudie Murphy\nEoin Lynch\nLee Madigan",

They join our 19s and B team in winning their tournaments in what has been a very good pre season for the club.\n\nThe first half was a close encounter with neither side getting a hold of possession or working either keeper. Both sides resorted to a ball over the top that was handled comfortably by both defences.\n\nThe second half was a more lively affair as both Ballingarry and Glin tried to created more chances to find that all important goal. Ballingarry’s young side grew into the game the longer it went on and chances started to come our way. Mike Molloy forced a brilliant save out of the Glin keeper from a free kick and and it was a Mike Molloy short corner to Lee Madigan who’s curling cross found the head of Aaron Smith who headed past the Glin net minder. Ballingarry sat back to defend what they had as Glin piled on the pressure from corners and free kicks. The pressure took its toll 3 mins from time when the Glin centre back headed against the post from a free kick delivery and he was able to knock the rebound past goal keeper Craig McInness. For the second time in two games we were going to penalties.\n\nThe penalties again were expertly dispatched by Ballingarry and Craig McInness saved one by brilliantly diving down to his left to deny Glin. Penalties were scored by: Kevin Forde, Declan Nash, Aaron Smith and Mike Molloy.\n\nWell done to all involved and the focus now turns to next weeks first competitive game a Munster Junior Cup tie at home to Glin. &#x1f7e2;&#x1f7e1;&#x1f3c6;&#x1f3c6;&#x1f3c6;",

Noel who not only played a major part in founding the club in 1984, served as our the first secretary, and was chairman of the club in the 1987/1988 season. Noel played in the clubs first ever competitive game on the 2nd of September 1984 in Askeaton on the day the boys from the garden town went on to win 4 goals to 3 and history was made. Noel lined out at fullback that day however is was as a goalkeeper he was to excel and where he played the majority of his 196 games. He won the clubs player of the year award in the 89/90 season and again in the 91/92 season. Noel was a passionate Ballingarry AFC man and an ardent Arsenal follower.\n\nOnce Noel retired from playing, he became a regular at the Paddocks on a Sunday to watch his beloved Ballingarry play. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for without him Ballingarry AFC may never have came to be. Thank you for helping create the greatest of memories from all in Ballingarry AFC\n\nThe club would like to extend its deepest condolences to Ester, James, Denis and Shauna and to all the Hayes family.\n\nWe will be doing a guard of honour after mass hoping all of Noels former teammates and current club members can join us.",

        "content:encoded": "FAI Youths Cup 4th Round\n\nBallingarry (2) 2 (Paudie Murphy 35 mins, 37 mins pen)\n\nSt Marys (1) 1 (Robert Docherty 2 mins)\n\n[ngg src=\"galleries\" ids=\"217\" display=\"basic_thumbnail\" thumbnail_width=\"240\" thumbnail_height=\"160\"]\n\nLast Saturday evening at Mick Hanley Park Ballingarry made light of the testing weather conditions to advance to the last eight of the FAI Youths Cup for the first time in the clubs history. Ballingarry did enough to edge out St Marys from Cork city by the odd goal in three and did do by overturning a poor start when they conceded a poor goal to the opposition.\n\nThe visitors got a dream start and were ahead after only two minutes. Ben Moynihan took the ball down their left and sent a low cross into the area where the ball broke but Ballingarry keeper Eoin O’Connor who didn’t gather the ball which then fell to centre forward Robert Docherty who blasted to the roof of the net. This gave Marys confidence and for the next ten minutes or so they were on top but really didn’t create clear openings. Gradually Ballingarry got into their stride and began to enjoy some good possession but like their opponents they were finding chances difficult to create. As the half wore on Ballingarry began to carve out a few openings like the one on twenty four minutes when Cian McGoey played a slide rule pass up to Paudie Murphy but the striker dragged his effort wide of the left hand post from sixteen yards. Ten minutes later TJ Tierney played the ball into space down the left for McGoey to run on to and he took the ball into the area, the covering defender got a slight touch on the ball before McGoeys shot was saved by the keeper with the ball then rebounding off the Ballingarry player for a goal kick.\n\nTen minutes to the break and Ballingarry were deservedly on level terms with a fine a goal as you are likely see. Murphy, having been picked out in space just inside the Marys half was still a long way from goal and had plenty to do. He took the ball down the line before coming inside towards the penalty area and dinked a beautiful chip with his left foot over the keeper and inside the rigging at the back post. Two minutes later it was advantage Ballingarry when Murphy converted from the penalty spot following a foul on Eoin Lynch. It certainly is a competition Paudie Murphy likes as in all of Ballingarrys games so far he has scored a brace in every game. Half time 2-1. \n\nBallingarry started the second half the better and two minutes in midfielder John Fitzgerald had a decent enough chance. Having been picked out by Adam Hickey down the right, the midfielder came inside towards the edge of the area but finished poorly by dragging his effort across goal and wide of the far post. Three minutes later keeper Eoin O’Connor did well to gather a Marys corner from the right in a crowded area before releasing left back TJ Tierney down the wing but his drilled cross was handled by Marys custodian Jake Healy. On the hour mark Cathal McMahon, on as a sub attacked down the right and his low cross almost picked out Cian McGoey but keeper Healy was brave to gather the ball at the feet of the Ballingarry forward.\n\nMarys goal scorer Docherty then linked well with Dave Culley whose effort was easily gathered by Eoin O’Connor in the Ballingarry goal. Moments later Cian Cullahane thought he had equalised for Marys but it was disallowed for offside. Marys were pushing forward more, but the Ballingarry defence, led superbly by skipper Brian Sheehy along with Jack Mullane, Cian O’Carroll and Tierney were giving nothing away. Ballingarry nearly got the insurance goal when confusion in the Marys defence saw a loose pass being played across their area with the ball coming to McMahon and with an open goal shot wide from thirty yards. However it didn’t matter as Ballingarry held on to achieve a deserved win and a win that sees them into the last eight in the country. \n\nBallingarry: Eoin O’Connor, Jack Mullane, TJ Tierney, Brian Sheehy (capt),\n\nCian O’Carroll, Adam Hickey, John Fitzgerald, Jamie Ryan, Eoin Lynch, Paudie Murphy, Cian McGoey. Subs Gary Storin, Cathal McMahon, Luke Hayes, Zach Hayes, Colin Bresnihan, Kieran Wall, Mark Ruddle. \n\nSt Marys: Jake Heaphy (capt), Jamie O’Connor, Jamie Barrington, PJ O’Donovan, Adam Murphy, Sean Daly, John O’Sullivan, Eugene Hendricks, Ben Moynihan, Robert Docherty, Shane Gostl.

Having\nbeen blessed with a crop such pedigree players each season it’s not surprising that they would be\ncapable of challenging for silverware in all competitions. But as players move out of the age group\neach season what may be surprising is the consistency of the youths teams. The one constant of\ncourse is the manager Dean Clancy who has been at the helm for that entire period. Dean’s\ncontribution to youth football within the club has been crucial, complemented by the expert\ncouching for the last 2 years by Mike Boyle and Shane Markham.\n\nLocally Balingarry are top of the league knowing one more win will secure the title, have already\nbooked themselves into the league cup final and are in the semi final of the Desmond cup. Having\nbowed out of the Munster Youth in the last 16 two weeks ago on a day when whatever could go\nwrong did go wrong, the FAI is the only trophy outside domestic competitions that is still on offer.\nBallingarry have scored 56 goals in their 16 games this season averaging over 3 goals a game and will\nrely again on strikers Paudie Murphy and Eoin Lynch to continue their fine goal scoring form. It has\nbeen an eventful journey to the QTR final playing Limerick giants Fairview in the first round having to\ngo to extra time to win 2:1. Kildimo from the Desmond league were next and a comfortable 4:2\nvictory at home set up a home tie against St Mary’s of Cork which was won 2:1 in Mick Hanley Park,\nClonreask.\n\nFree scoring St Francis are riding high too, top of the DDSL and look favourites to become\nchampions.\n\nSaturday represents possibly the toughest task the management will have encountered to date. But\nthere is a confidence and desire about this squad that suggests that the task is not unsurmountable.\nI’m sure the lessons are learnt from the recent disappointment of their Munster youth cup exit, and\nno doubt the manager will have the homework done\n\nBig day ahead team and management would really appreciate local and wider LDFL support.",

The general sale of seats will go ahead next week Friday 15th of April but we are writing to you a week beforehand to give lifetime members the opportunity to buy first. All contributors will be listed on the memorial contributor’s boards which will in turn be erected and remain permanently in the lobby of the clubhouse.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-11111\" src=\"http://ballingarryafc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JamesClancyGraphicStand.jpg\" alt=\"Artist Impression of new stand\" width=\"800\" height=\"565\"> Artist Impression of new stand[/caption]\n\nThere are two ways you can contribute:\n\n<strong>You can sponsor a seat in the stand for €100.</strong>\nOr\n<strong>For those who can afford, sponsor a seat for €250.</strong> As the James Clancy Stand is an approved\nproject under Revenue’s Tax Relief for Donations Scheme, the club would then receive an additional €167 from revenue based on your sponsorship of €250, bringing the total benefit to the club of €417.\n\nWe hope you will support this initiative in memory of James and help bring his vision of having a seated stand and full floodlights at the Paddocks to reality. The total cost of the project is €183,000 (€25,000 for the stand and €158,000 for the Floodlights).

Three goals in the final 15 mins gave Ballingarry what they deserved after a patient but brilliant performance. Eoin Lynch scored two goals in 5 mins in a game he worked tirelessly  and John Fitz finished off the game in style with a fantastic finish late on. TJ Tierney deservedly won Player of the match by putting in an immense performance in centre midfield.\n\nAttention now turns to Saturday afternoon where they take on Newcastle West to try and win a historic treble. Well done boys &#x1f7e2;&#x1f7e1;",
